{"1": [], "31411": "Some pathogenic bacteria are genetically very homogeneous, making strain discrimination difficult. In the last few years, tandem repeats have been increasingly recognized as markers of choice for genotyping a number of pathogens. The rapid evolution of these structures appears to contribute to the phenotypic flexibility of pathogens. The availability of whole-genome sequences has opened the way to the systematic evaluation of tandem repeats diversity and application to epidemiological studies. This report presents a database ( contains 30 comparable structures in which the unit is repeated at least 10 times. Half of these tandem repeats show polymorphism among the strains tested. Analysis of the currently available bacterial genome sequences classifies  strains typed here. The polymorphism associated with tandem repeats has been instrumental in mammalian genetics for the construction of genetic maps and still is the basis of  fingerprinting in forensic applications. Tandem repeats are usually classified among satellites (spanning megabases of , associated with heterochromatin), minisatellites (repeat units in the range 6-100 bp, spanning hundreds of base-pairs) and microsatellites (repeat units in the range 1-5 bp, spanning a few tens of nucleotides). More recently, a number of studies have supported the notion that tandem repeats reminiscent of mini and microsatellites are likely to be a highly significant source of very informative markers for the identification of pathogenic bacteria even when these pathogens are recently emerged, highly monomorphic species []. Mutation mechanisms of micro and minisatellites have been studied in some detail in eukaryotes, essentially human and yeast (reviewed in []. In bacteria, loci containing a tandem repeat from the microsatellite class (repeat unit sizes of 1-8 bp) have been called simple sequence contingency loci []. The pattern of variants along the array provides an additional level of allele identification and phylogenetic information. In addition, tandem repeats with longer repeat unit length can be relatively easily typed in the size range of a few hundred base-pairs using ordinary horizontal gel electrophoresis. In this report, we will first describe the use of a tandem repeats database for bacterial genomes (. Both ]). To date, 36 bacterial genome sequences from 32 species have been released in the public domain and are included in the database (Figure , presumably reflecting a significant contribution of tandem repeats to coding regions in these two bacteria. As a quick illustration of the use of this database to facilitate the development of genotyping tools for bacterial genomes, we have evaluated the polymorphism associated with tandem repeats from ). Figure . As can be seen, the repeat unit size and the overall length of the  products are such that tandem repeats differing by a single repeat unit can be distinguished by simple agarose gel electrophoresis. Given the relatively low overall size of most bacterial tandem repeats, tandem repeat search can be run even on unfinished sequences. Tandem Repeats Finder was applied to . We have looked for correlations between on one hand the number of alleles and polymorphism of the minisatellites, and on the other, simple structural characteristics of the tandem repeats in the sequenced strain : motif size, number of motifs, total length, conservation of the motifs along the array (percent identity),  content, strand bias. In the case of ). We limited here our investigation of tandem repeats to minisatellites, i.e. repeat units longer than 9 base-pairs, so as to avoid simple sequence contingency loci [. There is consequently a possibility that a common database format for identification and epidemiological analyses of pathogens amenable to minisatellite typing be developed. As more data becomes available on polymorphism associated with tandem repeats, it will be added to the database presented here in order to avoid duplication of work and nomenclature. Bacterial species differ very significantly in the density of tandem repeats within their genome, and also in their use of tandem repeats. Some species have a very strong excess of tandem repeats with repeat units length which are multiple of three, the most striking examples being ]. In the two species studied here, tandem repeat polymorphism is strongly correlated with one or more of the sequenced allele characteristics, as illustrated in Figure ]. However, more systematic allele sequencing will be required to demonstrate that polymorphism is not associated with a subclass of alleles showing a higher internal homogeneity. Similarly, allele sequencing will be required to formally establish that the allele size variations observed are indeed (as is likely) the consequence of variations in the number of repeats. Five among the ), so that a sequencing error is the most likely interpretation. This issue could be easily solved by typing with Ceb-Bams1 and Ceb-Bams28 the very strain which has been used for the sequencing project. It is interesting to observe that, although the magnitude of allele size difference has not been taken into account when building the distance matrix, the resulting phylogenetic tree proposed in Figure ] and suggest that mutation events are predominantly small size changes. Here again, more detailed studies involving full allele sequencing should now help understand the succession of events producing a population of alleles. Finished sequences in the public domain were recovered by ftp from the I or the Sanger center sites (.

In addition to the previously described general Tandem Repeats Database, we have developed a tool to automatically identify tandem repeats of a different length in the genome sequence of two (or more) closely related bacterial strains. Genome comparisons are pre-computed. The results of the comparisons are parsed in a database, which can be conveniently queried over the internet according to criteria of practical value, including repeat unit length, predicted size difference, etc. Comparisons are available for 16 bacterial species, and the orthopox viruses, including the variola virus and three of its close neighbors. We are presenting an internet-based resource to help develop and perform tandem repeats based bacterial strain typing. The tools accessible at  now comprise four parts. The Tandem Repeats Database enables the identification of tandem repeats across entire genomes. The Strain Comparison Page identifies tandem repeats differing between different genome sequences from the same species. The \"Blast in the Tandem Repeats Database\" facilitates the search for a known tandem repeat and the prediction of amplification product sizes. The \"Bacterial Genotyping Page\" is a service for strain identification at the subspecies level. Molecular epidemiology, the integration of molecular typing and conventional epidemiological studies, is likely to add significant value to analyses of infections caused by pathogenic bacteria (see []. The frequent observation that tandem repeat-containing genes are often associated with outer membrane proteins suggests that such genes help bacteria adapt to their environment, and may be to some extent mutation hotspots as a result of positive selection. Polymorphic tandem repeats (Rs, for Variable Number of Tandem Repeats), once identified, provide convenient tools requiring ordinary molecular biology equipment and the data can be easily exchanged and compared. The resulting assay, called A (for multiple locus R analysis) can even be automated []. The \"Blast in the Tandem Repeats Database\" page facilitates the search for a known tandem repeat, the prediction of  amplification products size, and the verification of primer specificity. Once an A assay has been set up, and carefully validated by typing collections of isolates, it is relatively easy to construct databases of genotypes to be used locally or which can be queried across the Internet. The \"Bacterial Genotyping Page\" illustrates a freely accessible, fast and easy to use internet-based service for strain comparisons, in which a user can compare a genotype produced for one of his isolates to the existing data. Tandem repeats were identified from finished microbial genome sequences (as listed by the Genome OnLine Database []. Sequence comparisons used  [] -for instance because there is only one copy of the repeated unit in the considered strain). The resulting list of matching tandem repeats was then imported in the database, where it can be queried. The comparison of more than two strains was made possible through a supplemental step before import in the database: the synthesis of several 2-strains comparisons, of the same \"reference\" strain against each of the others (matching between s of the different strains was deduced from the positions on the reference strain). The Blast Page allows users to run  [] in the tandem repeats and flanking sequences from the database via Perlscripts. The Blast outputs are linked to the database, in order to easily obtain the description of identified tandem repeats. The web-page site performing identifications was developed using the server application (version 3.0, Applied-Maths, Belgium) and  (Microsoft) using Perlscript. The typing results (gel images and resulting data) were managed using the Bionumerics software package as described in []. The output of a query is a list of strains and genotypes from the database together with similarity scores. Figure ] (input from users is welcome). Eventually, when an A assay has been fully developed and validated, typing data can be made accessible so that individual queries can be run. The Bacterial Genotyping Page illustrates how this could work. The genotyping data for a strain can be entered and submitted via this page. The output is the description of the closest strains. The data which has been submitted is not incorporated in the database itself, since this would require stringent data validation steps. In the following sections, we are presenting the web-based resources associated with this procedure. The strain comparison pages are available via [). The strain comparison page allows queries in the tandem repeats database according to the tandem repeat length difference between the two strains compared, and also to other tandem repeats characteristics (unit length, copy number, etc). Figure ]. When more than two strains have been sequenced, a synthesis of the results of several 2-strains comparisons is also available. Figure ). To facilitate the identification of already studied tandem repeats, we implemented  [strains H37Rv and 1551, providing different  product lengths. The Bacterial Genotyping page []. For each locus, allele sizes can be selected among a list of possibilities (observed sizes). The results of the query indicate a similarity score and include links to the complete data recorded for each strain listed. This page is just meant as an illustration and prototype. A reference data could also be made available for downloading as tabular data files, or can be copied from published datasets, which can then be complemented by in-house data, and analyzed by the appropriate clustering software. As shown by the indexes from Figure ]. The sequencing of more than one strain for some bacterial species allows direct identification of polymorphic tandem repeats, assuming that no sequencing errors occurred. Earlier investigations provide good reasons to believe that tandem repeats in the size range considered here (a few hundred base-pairs) are correctly sequenced, and consequently, that the strain comparison data is reliable. As a negative control, the comparison of two independent sequences from the same strain of ]. Selection based on comparison of sequence data from two strains will miss some polymorphic loci. Indeed, the results provided by the approach rely upon the phylogenetic distance between the two strains being compared. If the strains are very closely related, only a few s will be found different between them, but these tandem repeats will probably be the most polymorphic ones. Conversely, if the strains are distant in the phylogenetic tree, a larger number of polymorphic s will be found, some of them will be only moderately polymorphic. Obviously, when a few well-selected strains have been sequenced, it is likely that very few polymorphic tandem repeats are undetected in the Strain Comparison pages. It is of course still going to be very important to determine the  allele frequency for isolates carefully selected to be representative of the global diversity of a given pathogen before suggesting the configuration of an A assay to use in subsequent studies. In addition, those  markers that are highly polymorphic in diverse test panels of isolates may be monomorphic when applied to isolates responsible for local outbreaks. The configuration of  markers used to make up an assay needs to be determined empirically with representative local isolates and tailored to the study population and study questions. The identification of simple criteria able to predict tandem repeat polymorphism when genome sequence data is available for only one strain would indeed greatly facilitate the development of A assays. It would seem reasonable for instance to expect that the number of copies and the internal homogeneity of tandem arrays are strong predictors []. We take advantage here of the many strain comparisons which are made available via the strain comparison pages to evaluate such criteria. We have analyzed bacteria with at least three sequenced genomes (, polymorphic s have a higher internal conservation and total length than monomorphic ones. Copy number, which is correlated with total length, is also higher among polymorphic s. Selecting the longest and most conserved tandem repeats should thus improve polymorphic s identification. Table ). It is tempting to speculate that these observations are applicable to other species. Subsequently, we applied the criterion to ten of the 2-strains comparisons available on the Strain Comparison Page (Table . The finding that polymorphic tandem repeats have, on average, a higher internal conservation, total length, and copy number than monomorphic ones is in agreement with previous observations that  polymorphism is correlated with conservation in ]. Unfortunately, we show here that such simple prediction criteria may miss a very large proportion of polymorphic tandem repeats, and provide highly variable results in different species. This indicates that, in the absence of sequence data from two strains or more, the systematic testing of tandem repeats polymorphism across a set of relevant strains remains the most appropriate way to develop an A assay. Consequently, the Strain Comparison page is of great use when two strains or more have been sequenced. Bacterial strain typing at the subspecies level is essential for epidemiological issues in the context of disease control. This can be used to determine if an , tandem repeats typing is the method of choice for subspecies typing. In addition to the fact that these loci represent an important fraction of the existing polymorphism, it offers a number of practical advantages, including the ease of typing, and of data exchanges among different countries. It is hoped that the tools which are described here will help evaluate the potential of tandem repeats typing assays for a larger range of pathogens.

In several loci, the size of the repeat is listed differently for the different strains, which is due to different detections by the Tandem Repeats Finder, usually as a result of internal variations within the tandem array.

We report the first genetic characterization of wildtype measles viruses from Uganda. Thirty-six virus isolates from outbreaks in 6 districts were analyzed from 2000 to 2002. Analyses of sequences of the nucleoprotein (N) and hemagglutinin (H) genes showed that the Ugandan isolates were all closely related, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these viruses were members of a unique group within clade  Sequences of the Ugandan viruses were not closely related to any of the World Health Organization reference sequences representing the 22 currently recognized genotypes. The minimum nucleotide divergence between the Ugandan viruses and the most closely related reference strain, genotype D2, was 3.1% for the N gene and 2.6% for the H gene. Therefore, Ugandan viruses should be considered a new, proposed genotype (d10). This new sequence information will expand the utility of molecular epidemiologic techniques for describing measles transmission patterns in eastern Africa. Measles virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded  virus in the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Infection with this virus is typified by high fever, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, cough, and coryza (). This virus is monotypic, but genetic variation in the hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) genes can be analyzed by molecular epidemiologic techniques to study transmission patterns. This molecular information, in conjunction with standard case reporting and investigation, is useful in assessing the effectiveness of vaccination programs (). In Uganda, measles is still endemic despite the availability of a measles vaccine for almost 2 decades. This failure to completely control measles is mainly the result of inadequate coverage of measles immunization, which is a single dose of vaccine given at 9 months of age. The reported measles vaccination coverage rate in 2002 was only 74%. Given a seroconversion rate of &#x2248;85% for measles vaccine given at 9 months of age, &#x2248;37% of Ugandan children are expected to remain susceptible to measles. The measles vaccination coverage increased to 83% in 2003 and 2004. The number of measles cases reported to the Ugandan National Health Management Information System ranged from 57,347 in 1997 to 49,871 in 2002. Of the cases reported in 2002, 31% occurred in persons &gt;5 years of age. The Ministry of Health developed a 5-year plan (2002&#x2013;2006) aimed at reducing the illness and death caused by measles virus. The strategies include increasing routine immunization coverage, conducting vaccination campaigns for children 6 months to 15 years of age, providing vitamin A, and initiating a case-based measles surveillance system. In October 2003, Uganda conducted a catch-up campaign for children 6 months to 15 years of age that reached &#x2248;13.5 million children with measles vaccine, with a national coverage of 105%. This campaign resulted in a decrease in reported measles cases to 3,522 from January to August 2004, compared with 28,072 in 2003 and 33,633 in 2002 in the same period, with no deaths among confirmed measles cases as of August 2004. Case-based measles surveillance was established in 2003, and by August 2004, &gt;80% of districts were investigating measles cases according to the guidelines. Some information is available on circulating measles virus genotypes in western, central, and southern Africa, but little is known about circulating strains in eastern Africa, including Uganda. The  Regional Measles Laboratory at Uganda Virus Research Institute (I) undertook the present study to isolate and characterize circulating measles strains in Uganda. Specimens for virus isolation were collected from outbreaks in different districts of Uganda, sentinel sites, and Mulago hospital, the national teaching and referral hospital, in Kampala from 2000 to 2002. Staff members from the I were part of the outbreak investigation team and responsible for collecting specimens.

Templates were sequenced by using a cycle sequencing reaction with fluorescent dye terminators (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, , ), and the reaction products were analyzed by using an  3100 (Perkin-Elmer) automatic sequencer. Sequence data from multiple reactions were analyzed with version 10.1 of the Genetics Computer Group Package (Accelrys, San Diego, , ). Phylogenetic analyses, including bootstrap analysis, were performed by using P version 4.01 (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, , ). The sequence of the 450 nt coding for the 150 amino acids at the H terminus of the N gene was obtained for all the isolates, and the entire coding region of the H gene was sequenced for 2 representative isolates. Thirty-six measles virus isolates obtained from measles outbreaks (n = 8) and Mulago Hospital (n = 28) from 2000 to 2002 were selected for genetic analysis. Isolates were obtained from 6 districts within Uganda (), although most were obtained from patients in Kampala.

The Ugandan sequences were closest to the sequence of the genotype D2 reference strain. The minimum nucleotide divergence between the Ugandan viruses and the D2 reference strain was 3.1% for the N gene and 2.6% for the H gene (). Bootstrap analysis of Ugandan H-gene sequences and the  reference sequences showed 100% confidence in the group containing Ugandan viruses. When N-gene sequences were compared with  reference sequences and contemporary genotype D2 (), the Ugandan viruses should be considered as a new genotype of measles. The proposed genotype that includes the Ugandan viruses is genotype d10. Mvi/KampalaA/51.00-1 (GenBank accession nos. N:923185, H:923213) was chosen as the reference strain for d10 because it represents most isolates and grows to high titers in cell culture. This is the first report of the genetic characterization of wildtype measles from Uganda and the second that describes characterization of viruses from eastern Africa. Although this study was successful, it highlights some of the difficulties in performing virologic surveillance in developing countries. The relatively low rate of virus isolation in this study was surprising considering that all the specimens were collected within 7 days of rash onset. However, many specimens were not collected properly, and many arrived at the laboratory in poor condition because of inadequate transportation. Better training and adequate specimen-collection equipment and supplies could prevent some of these problems. In addition, many of the specimens were contaminated, and the filtration step for removing the contaminants reduced the viral titer. Specimens that do not require reverse cold chain, such as blood spots dried onto filter paper, will improve the efficiency of virologic surveillance in countries such as Uganda. Our results show that the percentage sequence divergence between the N and H gene sequence of the Ugandan virus isolates and the sequences of the reference strains exceeds the recommended threshold for designation of a new measles genotype, which is 2.5% and 2.0% minimum nucleotide divergence for the H region of the N and H genes, respectively (). The Ugandan viruses have a unique genetic signature that clearly distinguishes them from other African viruses. During the time when d10 viruses were isolated in Uganda, genotype D4 viruses were circulating in nearby Kenya (). Baseline virologic surveillance has not been conducted in Tanzania, Rwanda, or Burundi, the countries that border Uganda to the south. Therefore, the exact geographic distribution of genotype d10 viruses is unknown. The purpose of virologic surveillance is to establish the transmission pathways of measles virus. Both Uganda and Kenya have initiated accelerated measles control activities and successfully completed a baseline survey of viral genotypes. Molecular epidemiologic techniques will now be very useful in monitoring the transmission pathways in eastern Africa, contribute to the development of effective measles control strategies, and document the success of the measles vaccination program.

Anthrax and plague are diseases caused by respectively. These bacteria are etiological agents for worldwide zoonotic diseases and are considered among the most feared potential bioterror agents. Strain differentiation is difficult for these microorganisms because of their high intraspecies genome homogeneity. Moreover, fast strain identification and comparison with known genotypes may be crucial for naturally occurring outbreaks versus bioterrorist events discrimination. Thirty-nine strains, representative of the species genetic diversity, were genotyped by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using previously described Multiple Locus R Analysis assays (A). Results were compared to previous data obtained by standard genotyping system (capillary electrophoresis on automatic sequencer) and, when necessary, direct amplicon sequencing. A reference comparison table containing actual fragment sizes, sequencer sizes and Agilent sizes was produced. In this report an automated  electrophoresis apparatus which provides a cheaper alternative compared to capillary electrophoresis approaches was applied for genotyping of s. This equipment, uses pre-cast gels and provides easy transportation, low maintenance and overall general logistic requirements and costs, is easy to set up and provides rapid analysis. This platform is a candidate for on-site A genotyping of biothreat agents as well as other bacterial pathogens. It is an alternative to the more expensive and demanding capillary electrophoresis methods, and to the less expensive but more time-consuming classical gel electrophoresis approach. ]. The site of entry determines different forms of anthrax, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalation; the latter form is highly fatal, with a mortality rate of up to 80% in the absence of an adequate antimicrobial therapy. ].

Finally genetic characterization of isolates allows to increase information about worldwide bacterial distribution and epidemiology. Standard genotyping methods require either highly discriminative but heavy, and relatively expensive devices such as automated capillary electrophoresis devices, or cheaper, easy to use but more time consuming and with lower resolution power such as agarose gels (for a review of bacterial A genotyping see []. In this paper we evaluate this approach for genotyping analysis of the two major biothreat agents. In order to validate this platform, we compared the data produced by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to agarose gel based data (.

For chromosomal markers, reproducibility of the observed data allowed correct assignment of each allele for every locus (&lt;25% of unit length). However, for plasmid markers, since their shorter repeat unit and  product size compared to the chromosomal ones, we observed variability not exceeding one single additional base for each allele in repeated runs. Even with this additional base, correct assignment could be reproducibly done for the plasmid loci.

The intentional release of anthrax spores by mail in 2001 in the United States caused the death of five persons by inhalation anthrax and publicly demonstrated the bioweapon-associated threat, of which only the community of biodefence experts was previously aware. This increased the demands for a better genetic characterization of bioterrorism agents, in order to distinguish between natural outbreaks and/or intentional release of micro-organisms, and to help trace back the origin of an aggression. We have here evaluated the Agilent 2100 \"Lab on a Chip\" platform for genotyping of strains on. This assay runs in 30 minutes one 12 multiplexed  reactions chip, genotyping a single isolate at a time. For this reason this system is faster compared to automated sequencing devices, either slab gel or capillary based when a single strain has to be genotyped. Given the possibility to compare different chip runs in different times this device can immediately show identities or diversities between new isolates compared to already characterized ones. Moreover it has shown a high degree of automation either for amplicon separation or for digital output of results. Compared to previous genotyping methods, the Bionalyzer is more effective than standard ethidium bromide slab gel electrophoresis, giving reproducible, precise and more sensible output for the shortest repeat units. Since no fluorescent primers are required the assay is cheaper to maintain than 8000 or other sequencing machines. A rough estimation of the total cost of a 25 loci assay indicates that genotyping on this equipment is at least four to ten times less expensive than a capillary system assay, at low to medium throughput level. The equipment itself is cheaper, and both consumables and equipment can be stored for a long period of time and activated when needed. Finally, the results are comparable to those obtained by automated sequencers. This platform appears particularly useful when response time is the critical factor. We propose therefore such a system as a method suitable for high resolution identification of biothreat agents. To date this system is the most effective genotyping technology available for on-site investigations. Also, this platform may be used for fast quality-checking of type collection, and  preparations for biosecurity and strain accountability purposes. Typing data produced by the A approach can be easily compared using shared internet databases, as illustrated for instance in []. In this paper we describe a fieldable genotyping method for isolates, demonstrating to be, for a single genotyping, more rapid than traditional methods. The transfer on a new platform maintains reproducibility and precision to unambigously identify alleles. This method is shown to be a valid alternative to standard genotyping techniques for field characterization of important biothreat agents.

Canonical single nucleotide polymorphism (can) and multiple locus R analysis (A) typing has been used to examine this archival collection of isolates. The can study indicates that there are 5 different sub-lineages/sub-groups in China out of 12 previously described world-wide can genotypes. Three of these can genotypes were only found in the western-most province of China, Xinjiang. These genotypes were r.008/009, a sub-group that is spread across most of Europe and Asia; rust 94, a sub-lineage that is present in Europe and India, and rollum, a lineage that is also present in Europe. The remaining two can genotypes are spread across the whole of China and belong to sub-group r.001/002 and the rmes sub-lineage, two closely related genotypes. A typing adds resolution to the isolates in each can genotype and diversity indices for the r.008/009 and r.001/002 sub-groups suggest that these represent older and established clades in China. isolates were recovered from three can sub-groups (r.008/009, rust94, and rollum) in the western most portion of the large Chinese province of Xinjiang. The city of Kashi in this province appears to have served as a crossroads for not only trade but the movement of diseases such as anthrax along the ancient \"silk road\". Phylogenetic inference also suggests that the rmes sub-lineage, first identified in the original Ames strain isolated from Jim Hogg County, , is descended from the r.001/002 sub-group that has a major presence in most of China. These results suggest a genetic discontinuity between the younger Ames sub-lineage in Texas and the large Western North American sub-lineage spread across central Canada and the Dakotas. Ancient Chinese medical books suggest that an anthrax-like disease has been present in China for more than 5,000 years and that by 500&#x2013;600 . the epidemiology and symptoms of anthrax had been described []. The population structure of ]. This process for molecular typing has now been applied to the study of isolates from China. An archival collection of 191 isolates recovered from soil, including 107 isolates collected between 1981/1982 in Xinjiang province. This province is located in the western most tip of China and was one of the 10 regions surveyed in the study conducted from 1990&#x2013;1994. The remaining isolates originated from many regions across the whole of China. This report focuses on the molecular genotyping of these 191 isolates. Our goal was to determine the nature and distribution of genotypes found in China and to establish phylogenetic relationships between these isolates and those found elsewhere in the world. The original comparative analysis of 5  illustrates this original can tree and is used here to define important nomenclature and terminology. ] within groups (D) are illustrated in the table in the lower left. Neighbor-joining trees based upon additional A genotypes within each of these 5 can groups are illustrated in Figures 3 and 5. The basic tree is now defined by 7 sequenced genomes that form 7 sub-branches or sub-lineages ending in \"stars\" in Figure ] were placed into one and only one of these 12 sub-lineages or sub-groups. The 191 into or out of China, with 3 possibly involving the routes defined as the Silk Road. ]. The red routes include the western city of Kashi in Xinjiang Province, the main crossroads into China and around the Taklimakan Desert leading into the eastern Chinese provinces. The r.008/009 sub-group is a cluster that predominates throughout Europe, the Middle East and China. Xinjiang province had 49 of the worldwide total of 156 r.008/009 isolates (Table insert in Figure ). The remainder of China is dominated by the r.001/002 subgroup. Chinese isolates represent 74 of the 106 isolates from our worldwide collection of r.001/002 sub-group isolates (Figure ]). Only 9 of these isolates are from Xinjiang province to the west. Similarly there are 8 isolates out of 19 worldwide isolates in the rmes sub-lineage in the main parts of China. Can typing of these isolates has already indicated that there were 49 total Chinese isolates from the r.008/009 subgroup, 44 from the rust94 sub-lineage and 15 from the rollum (Figure . The identification of 14 genotypes for the r.008/009 sub-groups is an indication of a combination of possibly repeated introductions and infections and a significantly longer history for this particular clade in this region. . Representatives of these three sub-groups were only found in isolates recovered in Xinjiang Province, or in unknown locations within China (n = 2). All of these isolates were recovered from soil samples in this province. One of the more remarkable findings from the whole genome  analysis of 5 diverse isolates by Pearson et al. [] was a nearly total lack of homoplastic  markers in a query of the status of nearly 1,000  positions in 26 diverse isolates. This finding uncovered a phenomenon called \"branch collapse\" that resulted in a tree that had no branching except for those created by 7 sequenced reference genomes. The remaining 26 isolates were then either part of one of these seven \"sub-lineages\" or part of 5 non-branching nodes (\"sub-groups\") on one of the 7 branches. While the can tree is highly accurate in the typing of 1033 isolates, it lacks resolution because it reflects the results of only 13 of nearly 1,000 s. Improved resolution between two points was demonstrated by an extensive analysis of the Ames specific branch [ and an additional 5 Ames-like isolates from the  (Brachman collection, see Methods and Materials). The precise location for the recovery of these latter isolates is unknown except that they originated in Texas. These 19 isolates (8 Chinese, 10 Texas) and the Ames strain represent a highly resolved,  based rmes sub-lineage. These results indicate that the original Ames strain and a subset of 10 Texas isolates are decendents of a rare lineage that is otherwise only found in China. ]. A0728 was isolated in China in 1957 but the specific location/source of this isolate is unknown. The 15 marker A analysis (A15) of the 74 isolates belonging to the r.001/002 sub-group yielded 32 different genotypes (Nei Diversity Index = 0.108, Figures with a long and extensive evolutionary presence in China. . The r.001/002 sub-group has a relatively large diversity index (See Figure 2) and suggests that this sub-group has a long history in China with repeated outbreaks and eventual spread throughout much of the country. Human anthrax has been an old and continuous problem in many rural regions in China where as much as six percent of environmental samples have been found to be contaminated with . More specifically, 107 isolates were recovered from \"soil samples\" between 1981&#x2013;1982 from unspecified sites relatively close to the city of Kashi in this province. Kashi (also Kashgar, Kaxgar, K&#x1;xk&#x1;r) was a major \"oasis\" crossroads city along the ancient Silk Road and dates back more than 2,000 years []. Two of these towns, Zepu and Atushi, are located approximately 144 and 33 kilometers respectively from the city of Kashi. In the 1990&#x2013;1994 study, Zepu recorded 24 villages with 202 human infections and Atushi recorded 4 villages with 81 human infections. Despite a clear correlation between can genotypes from the A radiation and the spectrum of isolates found across the Trans-Eurasian continents, there is one set of genotypes in Europe that are clearly missing in China. These are representatives from the B branch that appear to be prevalent in several European states including at least 27 B2 isolates from France and isolates identified in both the B2 and B1 branches from Croatia, Germany, Poland, Italy, Norway and Slovakia []. Additional analyses with the rapidly evolving A markers suggest that establishment in China of two of these sub-groups/sub-lineages, rust94 and rollum, resulted from relatively recent events (Figure ], which could represent a common ancestor or an intermediate step in the transmission route. By direct contrast the A analysis of 49 isolates belonging to the r.008/009 sub-group revealed a more complex pattern with 14 different A15 genotypes (Nei Diversity Index = 0.143, Figures ], has had an extensive history in China. It is difficult to determine the precise origins of the r.008/009 subgroup (e.g. China versus Europe) at this point because rapidly evolving A markers are subject to homoplasy and potentially inaccurate phylogenetic reconstructions. These issues can eventually be resolved using additional whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic inference to more accurately predict the origins of the r.008/009 sub-group. The Ames sub-lineage appears to have descended from the r.001/002 sub-group, a sub-group that has 106 isolates in our worldwide collection []). How then did the Ames lineage come to Texas and why is this lineage not found in Europe? This is still not known and subject to considerable speculation. By several accounts, it is believed that anthrax was introduced into the Gulf Coast states (Louisiana and Texas) by early settlers from Europe. Stein []. ]). Darker colors represent severe outbreaks and the lighter colors represent sporadic outbreaks. The blue and green colors were used to illustrate that two distinct genotypes (Western North America () and the Ames sub-lineage) have been indentified in \"modern\" isolates from these two regions. The counties bordered in yellow in Texas indicate counties where documented incidents of anthrax have occurred between 1974 and 2000. The numbers 1&#x2013;4 indicate the counties in which the original Ames strain, 2 bovine samples and a goat sample have been analyzed by current genotyping methods as belonging to the Ames sub-lineage. The molecular analysis of more than 200 isolates from North and South Dakota indicates a pre-dominance of the sub-lineage  in this region. The gray colors indicate moderate to sparse outbreaks in the states adjoining the Dakotas and Texas. An important feature of the outbreaks in Texas is that the \"modern\" outbreaks have occurred repeatedly in many of the same counties depicted in this historical map (Figure ]. It appears that and these estimates suggest that the Western North American and the Ames lineages shared common ancestors between 2,825 and 5,651 years ago. Extrapolating to the much shorter  distances between the most recent Chinese isolate (A0728) and the recent Texas isolates on the Ames sub-lineage would approximate that these two shared a common ancestor between 145 to 290 years ago. These estimates would be consistent with the hypothesis that an Ames-like isolate was introduced into the Galveston and/or New Orleans area in the early to middle 1800s. This relatively recent expansion is in direct contrast to analyses of the Western North American () sub-lineage that appears to have an ancient and significantly longer evolutionary presence in North America; this group stretches from the central regions of Canada and into North and South Dakota (Figure ] suggest that the ancestral isolates may have entered the North American continent via the Beringian straights 13,000 years ago. A recent ecological niche model suggests that natural anthrax outbreaks are \"concentrated in a narrow corridor from southwest Texas northward into the Dakotas and Minnesota\" [century. Limited sample analysis of isolates from the Texas/Louisiana coastline prevents any conclusions about the overall dominance of the Ames sub-lineage in this area and we also cannot exclude the possibility that there are other sub-groups/sub-lineages that might have been imported and even become transiently established along the Texas/Louisiana Gulf region during this same time frame. Despite containing only 5 of the initial 12 can genotypes used to define a collection of world-wide isolates [isolates reveals an interesting impact on global distribution. The major diversity in these isolates is concentrated in the western province of Xinjiang and especially the city of Kashi, the hub of the Silk Road around the Taklimakan Desert into and out of China. These results reinforce the idea that this Silk Road region was central to the spread of anthrax between the trans-Eurasian continents. In addition to the three distinct sub-groups found in the western Xinjiang province, the central and eastern regions of China are dominated by a different, highly diverse, can sub-group, r.001/002. This sub-group is a major presence in relationship to our world-wide collection since 70% of all the isolates and most of the diversity for this sub-group were in this Chinese collection. These results suggest that the r.001/002 cluster may have originated in China. Finally, the Ames and Ames-like strains in Texas are descended from common ancestors in Inner Mongolia in China as an extension of this sub-group. It is curious that this lineage would become established in Texas, and perhaps Louisiana, and not in Europe. This leaves behind a missing historical gap within the phylogeography of the Ames lineage. The 191 ] and an additional 5 isolates that were obtained from the  as part of the \"Brachman Collection\" (  # 34064, 34279, 402, 482, 490). All 11 of these isolates belong to the Ames sub-lineage and all were isolated in Texas between 1959&#x2013;2007. This analysis also includes the original Ames strain that was isolated in 1981 from bovine in Jim Hogg County. All isolates were initially genotyped for a ]. TaqMan&#x2122; -Minor Groove Binding () allelic discrimination assays were designed for each of 13 cans and have been described in great detail by Van Ert et al. []. Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat (R) Analysis (A) was used to determine the overall diversity of the isolates within each sub-group and sub-lineage. The first 8 marker set used in this analysis were initially described by Keim et al., [] with the genomic positions and primer sets for these assays described in Supplemental Tables 2 and 6 of this reference. The genetic relationships among the Chinese isolates were established using a hierarchical approach where the slowly evolving, highly conserved, can markers were first used to place each isolate into its appropriate clonal lineage. The 15 more rapidly evolving, R loci, were then used to measure the genetic diversity and to determine the number of specific genotypes within each of these clonal lineages.

The results obtained are in full agreement with the view that the . Plague, one of the most devastating infections in human history, is a zoonotic infection that spreads to humans from natural rodent reservoirs, commonly via the bite of an infected flea , some of which may help overcome natural selective forces. These variations may be used as markers to reconstruct the historical spread of plague. Because of its importance in human history, many investigations have aimed at deciphering the evolution of this major pathogen. In the decades following its identification by Alexandre Yersin in 1894, biochemical characteristics were identified, allowing the typing of strains. Some of these characteristics could be shown to constitute a strong phylogenetic signal. This led to the well-known classification of the typical human pathogenic ). Much more discriminatory molecular typing methods have been described in the past few years. Some of these methods can be used in many laboratories to produce data which can be easily merged and compared without the need to exchange live strains, or other biological material. As a result, it is now possible to re-examine the founding hypotheses and the classifications underlying them. These methods include single nucleotide polymorphism () analysis  by using 25 and 42 R loci, respectively. Until now the available A data of .

From left to right, the columns designate the strain Id, focus of origin, biovar (bv.), subspecies (subsp.), geographic origin (location), host or vector, genomovar based on  analysis . The biovar or subspecies designation follows current usage, with inconsistencies in terms of a future nomenclature since &#x201C;biovar Microtus&#x201D; contains a number of &#x201C;subspecies&#x201D;. The &#x2018;genomovar+X&#x2019; and &#x2018;genomovar-X&#x2019; respectively indicates that the strain is similar to this genomovar except for X which was present or absent.

This cluster also contains the African bv. Antiqua strains (from the Albert and Edouard lakes in Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo). The global organization for . These two branches were classified as Asian and African but the present study clearly illustrates that both bv. Antiqua clusters are largely represented in China. In a previous report, 909 Chinese isolates were grouped into 32 genomovars based upon presence-absence of 23 s ). Therefore, R analysis with the 25 loci provides much finer resolution compared with  analysis while the clustering it achieves is in agreement with the geographic origin of the isolates and the overall  results. Three foci in the Xinjiang province of China, foci A, B (including subfoci B1&#x2013;B4) and O are geographically linked to the plague foci of Central Asia (). The 6 isolates from mesofocus (subfocus) 37 (Tuva focus in Russia, brown colored focus,  isolates between these areas is not unlikely. Similarly focus 33 (Aksai focus in Kirghizia) is adjacent to foci A and B1 in Xinjiang province of China and the similarity among the isolates in these 3 foci is not surprising. The bv. Antiqua group predominantly associated with isolates from the H focus in Song-Liao Plain of China also contains the isolates from focus  (Khentei Province in Mongolia) and four isolates from focus 38 (Trans-Baikal focus in Russia; blue foci in ). Genetically closely related bv. Antiqua and bv. Medievalis strains have been isolated from the H focus. It is tempting to speculate that this focus may represent the origin of emergence of bv. Medievalis. A homogeneous group of bv. Microtus strains as assigned here by A, or previously by  (genomovar 14 or minor variants) and  analysis, is consistently found in foci L (Microtus/ would have been rhamnose positive. These observations lead to the following clonal expansion model. The spread of bacteria is a dynamic process, and the strains persisting in natural plague foci are not fixed. The observed genetic similarities between the different foci suggest that different patterns of transmission and fixation coexist. In some cases, it is likely that localized spreading occurred. Similar terrain and landscape in adjacent area facilitated the transmission of the isolates via their hosts from one location to the other and gradually gave rise to a present-day focus that is slightly different from the original one. This is a common transmission pattern and the evolution of isolates in foci 33, A, and B1 fits this pattern, as well as the foci C, D, and K2 in China. The strain transmission among foci B2, B3, and B4 in Xinjiang province of China also probably results from localized spreading . The second pattern of spread is point-to-point transmission: bacteria from one focus may be carried to a remote region by various events, such as migration of hosts or transportation of goods, or movement of human beings infected by the pathogen. This mode of spread is particularly seen in the  pathogenic for humans, which have been very successful in their geographic colonization. Long-distance transmission of isolates could lead to two outcomes 1) the bacteria could not adapt to the local surroundings and will disappear (as illustrated for the first, second and third pandemic which did not leave natural foci in Europe, as well as the third pandemic in Australia); 2) where the ecosystem is similar to the original focus, the bacteria could survive and cause epizootics in local hosts, and hence a natural focus with similar isolates would form. The African Antiqua foci would be an illustration. This pattern may account for the fact that isolates from focus L and M, G and H possessed the same  profiles and similar R patterns, respectively. It is also well illustrated by the bv. Medievalis isolates established with little genetic diversity from China to the Caspian Sea, and more recently by the world-wide spread of the Orientalis biovar in the course of the third pandemic. These transmission patterns interact with each other to form the current distribution of . In this study, based on 25 R A analysis, the data derived from more than 500 ; this genetic divergence will have occurred independently of the Chinese lineages. In this view, it seems very difficult to imagine that bv. Orientalis could have been the cause of all three pandemics. This would imply that, whereas bv. Orientalis very successfully led to the creation of new natural foci during the third pandemic, it failed to do so during the first two. Conversely, the role of bv. Antiqua and bv. Medievalis which similarly proved able to induce the formation of natural foci from China to Africa or to the Caspian Sea respectively are strengthened as excellent candidates for being the agent of the first and second pandemic. It is the very high typing resolution of A which demonstrates the very limited genetic diversity of the  strains present outside China, compared to the extensive diversity present in China. Data presented here will be of great assistance in the development of a genomic polymorphism database of  isolates in laboratories in China, France and Russia, independently, without the need for strain or even  exchange, using a standardized protocol. The data could be exchanged and merged for combined analysis, which gave us a model how to develop databases for molecular epidemiology, surveillance or forensic microbiology of some highly dangerous pathogens. The  bv. Antiqua-Medievalis group, dendrogram based on the 25 R loci A color code is assigned to the main clusters: blue, predominantly bv. Antiqua from the H,  and 38 foci, with a single strain from the G focus; green, bv. Antiqua from Tibet (G focus and Nepal); red, bv.

Data from Wave 1 of the International Tobacco Control () China Survey (April&#x2013;August 2006) were analysed. The  China Survey employed a multistage sampling design in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Changsha, Guangzhou and Yinchuan (none of which has comprehensive smoke-free policies in place). Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 4815 smokers and 1270 non-smokers. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with support for comprehensive smoke-free policies. About one in two Chinese urban smokers and four in five non-smokers believed that secondhand smoke () causes lung cancer. The majority of respondents supported comprehensive smoke-free policies in hospitals, schools and public transport vehicles while support for smoke-free workplaces, restaurants and bars was lower. Levels of support were generally comparable between smokers and non-smokers. Support for comprehensive smoke-free policies was positively associated with knowledge about the harm of . Respondents who worked in a smoke-free worksite or who frequented smoke-free indoor entertainment places were more likely to support comprehensive smoking restriction in bars and restaurants. Considerable support for smoke-free policies exists in these six large cities in China. Greater public education about the dangers of  may further increase support. Experiencing the benefits of smoke-free indoor entertainment places and/or workplaces increases support for these policies and suggests that some initial smoke-free policy implementation may hasten the diffusion of these public health policies. Secondhand smoke () exposure causes death, disease and disability. Workplaces and public venues are common sources of  exposure; therefore, restricting smoking in these venues through smoke-free policies is an effective way to reduce  exposure and to protect health. China does not have a comprehensive smoke-free law at the national level. However, several national laws and policies regulate smoking in public places. For example,  Only a few cities&#x2019; local laws are more stringent than the national laws. For example, Guangzhou&#x2019;s local smoke-free law bans smoking in workplaces and restaurants with air conditioning, which is beyond the scope of the national laws. By ratifying the C, China has agreed that all workplaces and public places should be smoke-free by 2011. Recently, efforts have been made in China to expand smoke-free places. At the national level, the central government is revising the . At the local level, many cities are also strengthening smoke-free policies. For example, in March 2008, Beijing released its new regulations on the scope of banning smoking in public places, which restrict smoking in workplaces though they are not comprehensive and designated smoking rooms are still allowed. In addition, the new regulations require restaurants to set up non-smoking areas, which makes Beijing the third city (along with Guangzhou and Shenzhen) in China that partially bans smoking in restaurants. Just like in the United States where the first smoke-free policies were incremental but they laid the framework for subsequently stronger policies, the new Beijing regulations are considered an important step towards the fulfilment of Article 8 of the C and will lead the way for the rest of China. Despite the progress being made, China is still far from 100% smoke-free in public venues and workplaces, though the deadline to fulfil the country&#x2019;s commitment to Article 8 in C is very close. We expect that China will formulate stronger smoke-free policies in the coming years. Thus, to study China's attitudes towards smoke-free policies and factors associated with support for smoking bans is valuable and has important policy implications. Previous studies suggest that comprehensive smoke-free policies are popular, However, all of these studies were conducted in Western countries with different cultural norms about smoking, and it is unclear if these findings will generalise to China, where one-third of the world smokers live. The current study uses data from six cities in China to address three research questions: (1) what are the smoke-free policies in six large Chinese cities; (2) what percentage of smokers and non-smokers support comprehensive smoke-free policies in different public venues and workplaces; and (3) what factors are associated with support for comprehensive smoke-free policies? The  China Survey is a prospective cohort survey in six large cities in China: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Changsha and Yinchuan. The Wave 1 survey was conducted between April and August 2006. About 800 smokers and 200 non-smokers were interviewed in each city for a total of 4815 smokers and 1270 non-smokers completing the Wave 1 survey across cities. Subsequent waves of data collection are being performed in this cohort, but for the purposes of this paper only data from the baseline 2006 survey are analysed. In this paper, a smoker refers to a respondent who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoked at least weekly at recruitment, and a non-smoker refers to a respondent who had not smoked 100 cigarettes in lifetime or who didn&#x2019;t smoke weekly at recruitment. The six cities were selected based on their size, diverse geographic location and level of economic development (see  In 2006, all the six cities had comprehensive or partial smoke-free policies for hospitals, conference rooms, public transportation vehicles and schools. However, for restaurants and workplaces, only Guangzhou had partial smoke-free policies (places with air conditioning are required to be smoke-free), and the other five cities had no restrictions on smoking in these two kinds of venues. The geographical distribution of the  China cities. Population size and the smoking policies in different venues in the six cities in 2006 In each city, the  China Survey employed a multistage cluster sampling design where 10 street districts (Jie Dao) were randomly selected, with probability of selection proportionate to the population size of the Jie Dao. Within each of these Jie Dao, two residential blocks (Ju Wei Hui) were selected with probability proportionate to the population size of the Ju Wei Hui. Within each selected Ju Wei Hui, a complete list of addresses of the dwelling units (households) was compiled and a simple random sample without replacement of 300 households was drawn from the list to construct the sampling frame. Each of these 300 households was visited to attempt to complete a survey(s), and information on age, gender and smoking status for all adults living in each household was collected. The enumerated 300 households were then randomly ordered, and adult smokers and non-smokers were then approached face to face following the randomised order until 40 adult smokers and 10 adult non-smokers were surveyed. Because of low smoking prevalence among women, one male smoker and one female smoker from every selected household were surveyed whenever possible to increase the sample size for women. At most one non-smoker was interviewed per household. Where there was more than one person in a sampling category to choose from in a household, the next birthday method was used to select the individual to be interviewed. After providing the potential respondent with information about the survey they completed the consent form, the average time to complete a survey was 31.4 minutes for smokers and 10.6 for non-smokers, with respective interquartile ranges of approximately 10 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. Interviewers followed a strict protocol in their interview session with each respondent. Up to four visits to a household were made in order to interview the target person(s) within that household. The Wave 1 cooperation rates, defined as the proportion of all respondents interviewed of all eligible subjects ever contacted, ranged from approximately 80% in Beijing and Guangzhou to 95% in Changsha. The response rates, defined as the proportion of all cases interviewed of all subjects that we tried to reach, ranged from 39.4% in Yinchuan to 66.0% in Guangzhou. All materials and procedures used in the  China Survey were reviewed and cleared for ethics by the research ethics board at the University of Waterloo and by the institutional review boards at the China National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To understand the current smoke-free law in each city, during the field work we collected the local smoke-free law in each city. These laws were reviewed to address the first research question. The dependent variable in this study is support for comprehensive smoke-free policies in various public places. In the survey, respondents were asked, &#x201C;for each of the following public places, please tell me if you think smoking should not be allowed in any indoor areas, should be allowed only in some indoor areas, or no rules or restrictions.&#x201D; Venues being asked include hospitals, workplaces, conference rooms, restaurants or bars, public transportation vehicles, and schools. The major independent variables and control in this study include: Sampling weights were constructed to provide the best possible prevalence estimates. The weights were constructed separately for male adult smokers, female adult smokers, and adult non-smokers. Wave 1 weights were constructed by taking into account the four levels of sample selection: Jie Dao, Ju Wei Hui, household and individual. The final weight for a sampled individual was the number of people in the city population and the sampling category represented by that individual. A full description of the weighting methodology is available at . All results reported in this paper are weighted statistics unless otherwise noted. S for Windows version 13.0 was used for all analyses. The percentages of respondents who support comprehensive smoke-free policies in different venues were computed. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to examine factors associated with comprehensive smoke-free policies. The analyses were conducted with the S complex samples module to account for the possible nested effects within cities. All the analyses were stratified by smoking status.  describes the sample characteristics and the belief about the adverse health effects of . The majority (94.9%) of the smoking respondents are male, but among non-smokers, females represented a majority of the sample. More than 30% of the study respondents were aged 55 years or older. Over 90% of both non-smokers and smokers belonged to the Han ethnic group. A key group difference was noted for knowledge of  effects&#x2014;53.6% of the smokers and 81.4% of the non-smokers endorsed the belief that  causes lung cancer in non-smokers.

Smokers&#x2019; support is highest for public transportation vehicles (93.6%) and schools (93.5%), followed by hospitals (73.7%), conference rooms (73.4%), workplaces (42.8%) and restaurants or bars (21.3%). Non-smokers&#x2019; support tends to be higher than smokers, but shows similar patterns. Support for total smoking bans in different venues among smokers and non-smokers in six cities in China. Notes: National level smoke-free laws are in place for schools, public transportation vehicles, conference rooms and hospitals. No national laws restrict smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars. According to the local smoke-free laws in the six cities, smoking is allowed in workplaces, restaurants and bars except that Guangzhou bans smoking in workplaces and restaurants with air conditioning. ), the two venues with the lowest support level for total smoking ban. Several factors were associated with support for total ban in both venues. For example, knowledge about the adverse health effects of  was positively associated with smokers' support for total ban in both venues and non-smokers' support for total ban in restaurants/bars. Older and lighter smokers were more likely to support smoke-free policies in these two venues compared with younger and heavier smokers. Self-reported smoking rules at workplaces were associated with support for total ban at workplaces among both smokers and non-smokers. Compared to respondents who work at places without restrictions on smoking, those who work at places with total a smoking ban were more likely to support total ban. Similarly, self-reported smoking rules in indoor entertainment places that the respondents go to most often were also associated with support for a total ban in restaurants and bars among smokers. Respondents who went to indoor entertainment venues with total smoking bans were more likely to support total ban in restaurants or bars. Several factors differed in terms of the association with support for total ban in the two venues. Female smokers were more likely to support total smoking ban in workplaces, but this association only showed borderline significance for restaurants or bars (&#x200A;=&#x200A;1.61, 95%  0.99 to 2.59). With regard to the differences between cities, smokers and non-smokers in Yinchuan were more likely to support a total ban in workplaces than those in Beijing; while for restaurants or bars, smokers in Shenyang and non-smokers in Guangzhou were more likely to support total ban compared to those in Beijing. Results of multivariate logistic regression models predicting support for total smoking ban at workplaces , secondhand smoke. Results of multivariate logistic regression models predicting support for total smoking ban in restaurants or bars , secondhand smoke. This study is the first to examine the support for smoke-free policies in different venues among urban residents in China. The major findings of the current study include: (1) in the six cities, support for total smoking ban in schools, public transportation vehicles, hospitals, and conference rooms was relatively high among both smokers and non-smokers, while support for a total ban in workplaces, restaurants and bars was present in a sizeable minority of respondents; (2) knowledge about the adverse health effects of  and the presence existing smoke-free policies was associated with increased support for a total smoking ban in workplaces, restaurants and bars. Studies in other countries suggest that support for bans was strongest for those with bans already in place. In this study, 21.3% of the smokers in the six cities support total smoking ban in restaurants or bars (much higher than support among Irish smokers before the Ireland smoke-free policy). Therefore, although this study shows that support for total smoking ban in workplaces, restaurants and bars was relatively low among urban residents in China, it does not necessarily mean that China cannot enforce comprehensive smoke-free policies in these venues. On the contrary, the results of this study suggest that, like smokers in other countries, Chinese smokers are likely to adapt to and even eventually support smoking bans. Knowledge about the adverse health effects of  is associated with support for total smoking ban in workplaces, restaurants or bars. This is consistent with previous studies. In the present study, only 53% of the smokers knew that  causes lung cancer, which is lower than in Western countries. For example, in the  four-country survey conducted in 2002, this statistics was 76.9% in Canada, 82.6% in the United States, 82.2% in United Kingdom and 72.1% in Australia. There is still room to increase Chinese urban smokers&#x2019; knowledge level about the health harm of . We should educate the public knowledge about  as this may increase public support for smoke-free policies. Differences between cities do not show a consistent pattern. One might have predicted that the highest levels of support for smoke-free bars and restaurants to be found in Guangzhou, where partial smoking restrictions were in place at the time the survey was conducted; however, this association was only observed among non-smokers. This may be attributed to the weak nature of the Guangzhou smoke-free policy. The Guangzhou smoke-free law is not comprehensive and exceptions are allowed in restaurants, and the enforcement of the law is also limited. Such a policy may only have very limited effects. Therefore, the Guangzhou public doesn&#x2019;t truly experience a complete smoke-free environment. This finding indicates that a partial smoking ban may be ineffective and not as popular as comprehensive smoke-free laws in other countries. We found some age and gender differences in this study. Generally, older people were more likely to support smoke-free policies in workplaces, restaurants or bars, a finding consistent with previous studies. Female smokers were more likely to support total smoking ban in workplaces, restaurants or bars, which is inconsistent with findings by Borland  One possible interpretation is the cultural differences between China and Western countries. However, because the number of female smokers is very small in this study, further studies with larger sample size of female smokers are needed to verify this finding. Heavier smokers are less likely to support comprehensive smoke-free policies. Future research is needed from longitudinal samples to determine whether the support for smoke-free policies in these population changes over time and what factors drive those changes. The strengths of the current study include a large sample size, a representative sample of smokers and non-smokers in each city, and the multi-city design which allows us to do comparisons among cities. There are several limitations in the study. First, the study was conducted in only six Chinese cities. The study sample is not representative of the whole Chinese population, and the results cannot be generalised to the national level. The rural population, which represents 54.3% of the total population in China, was not examined in this study. Perhaps a similar study conducted in rural areas of China can help address this limitation. Second, because older people were more likely to be at home and to cooperate with the investigation, this study slightly oversampled older respondents, which may result in biased estimates. However, the weighting procedure used in the analyses may help reduce the bias. Third, because of the cross sectional feature of the baseline data, this study is not able to make causal links. Fourth, the cooperation rate and the response rate vary among cities. The reason might be the differences in culture and economic levels. It is not clear whether and how those who refused to participate in the study differ from those who completed the survey, and this may generate bias in the results. Lastly, there are minor differences among surveys in different countries, which made some comparison among countries hard to do. For example, the  China Survey asked for respondents&#x2019; attitudes towards smoking ban in &#x201C;restaurants or bars&#x201D;, while the  surveys in other countries asked about restaurants and bars separately. Considerable support for smoke-free policies was observed in six cities in China. The current study suggests that smoke-free policies are popular. Once smoke-free policies are implemented, both smokers and non-smokers adapt and support these policies. The level of public knowledge about the adverse health effects of  was associated with support for smoke-free policies. The opportunity is ripe for public education to further boost awareness of  and support for smoke-free policies in China. The authors would like to acknowledge the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the local  representatives in each city for their role in data collection. .  None.

It was observed that Microtus strains were different from the other three biovar strains. Each plague focus had its own unique A types. The strains isolated from Yulong, Yunnan province had a unique A type, indicating a new clone group. Our results suggest that Yulong strains may have a close relationship with strains from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau plague focus.

From left to right, the columns designate the A types, plague foci, biovar, and number of isolates with identical A type and plague focus, repeat number of 14 loci (M76, M73, M72, M66, M61, ms01, M59, M58, M55, M54, M52, M51, M49, and M37).

According to cluster analysis based on 85 s (Figure ), Microtus isolates comprising 79 to 85 (Group A) could be correctly distinguished from Antiqua, Orientalis and Medievalis. Within Microtus, the strains from two foci (L and M) could be further separated. Most Orientalis isolates were clustered into one major branch (Group B) with the exception of the strains representing 09 and 35. Similarly, 80% (20/25) of Medievalis isolates were also clustered together (Group C). As a complementary analysis, a  analysis was performed based on the categorical data sets (Figure ). Complex 3 contained 18 Medievalis strains, which was account 72.00% (18/25) of all the Medievalis strains in this study, and three Antiqua strains. Complex 4 and complex 5 were constructed by Antiqua strains. Most of strains in complex 4 were from Focus G, while most of strains in complex 5 were from Focus  All the Microtus isolates constituted complex 6, which was a well-defined complex representing Microtus isolates. . A minimum spanning tree was constructed using the genotyping data provided in figure 1. In the minimum spanning tree the A types are displayed as circles. The size of each circle indicates the number of isolates with this particular type. Thick solid lines connect types that differ in a single R locus and a thin solid connects types that differ in 2 R loci. The colors of the halo surrounding the A types denote types that belong to the same complex. A complexes were assigned if 2 neighboring types did not differ in more than 2 R loci and if at least 3 types fulfilled this criterion. . There are 16 plague foci in China. The names of plague foci represented by letters were according with that in table 1. Strains from each focus presented their own unique s. For example, 39 to 43 were only found in Focus A, 44 to 51 were only found in Focus B, and 17 was only found in Focus  A total of 72 s were found in the specific foci (Figure ). However, some strains isolated from different foci could share the same s. There were a total of 12 s (09, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 35, 44, 52, 63, and 76) covering strains isolated from different foci. 09 was shared by 10 strains isolated from 4 foci (C, D, J, F), including the main strains from Focus  19 was shared by 10 isolates from 3 foci (D, C, K), including the main strains from Focus  The other 10 s covered strains of 2 foci. Most strains from the same focus presented the same or similar s (Figure ). For example, the five strains in Focus P had exactly the same  (17), and 6 of 9 bacteria isolated from Focus J had the same  (53). The 11 strains of Focus A as a subgroup had very similar s, including seven strains for 42 and other four strains for 4 s with one to three loci different from 42. Most of the strains in Focus F were clustered together, including 14 strains for 76 and the other six strains presenting in 6 s. On the other hand, strains from the same focus were dispersed in the cluster tree. For example, strains isolated from Focus G were dispersed in complex 1, 3 and 4, and strains from Focus C were scattered in complex 1 and 4. Five strains isolated from Yulong, Yunnan had the same  (17: 2-2-2-4-4-7-7-6-2-4-3-3-3-5). Three s with a difference in only one locus from 17 were as follows: 18 (2-2-2-4-4-7-7-7-2-4-3-3-3-5), including the strains from Foci C and G, had one copy difference on locus M58 with 17; 16 (2-2-2-4-4-7-7-6-2-4-3-2-3-5), including a strain which was isolated from Focus H, had one copy difference on locus M51 with 17; 29 (2-2-2-4-4-7-7-6-2-4-3-3-3-4), including a strain which was isolated from Focus C, had one copy difference on locus M37 with 17. The geographic locations of the natural plague foci adjacent to Yulong were C, E, and F (Figure ) showed that strains from Foci P, C, and E had a close relationship, and almost all strains belonged to one group. In 2001, Klevytska ]. However, a small number of strains from different foci had the same or similar s, suggesting that more R loci should be tried to find out the combination of R loci which could distinguish the strains among different foci completely, or that these strains from different foci may have the same source from another point of view. For example, we observed no considerable differences in the isolation times and places between the only human isolates (N010024, 03) and the other strains isolated from Focus  However, we did find a marked difference in  In previous studies, epidemiological investigations and traditional ecological typing studies confirmed that this case was imported from Focus C []. In this study, N010024 was significantly different from the other strains isolated from Focus M, but had very similar  with the strains from Focus C and gathered with them in the same subgroup. These results coincided with the conclusion of epidemiological investigations and the ecological typing, which further supported A as a bacterial typing method suitable for field epidemiological investigations. There were cross-types among the s of strains from different foci, with 09 and 19 being the most prominent. Foci that contained the same  were geographically close to each other (Figure ]. Cluster analysis showed that majority of the strains in the four foci were in complex 1, indicating a close relationship. Therefore, we suggest that more accurate results will be obtained by combining the four foci in a unit when performing epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis. Foci A, B, and K are in Xinjiang province (Figure ). The strains from Foci A and B were in the long branch of complex 1 and obviously different from other strains isolated in China. On the contrary, most strains from Focus K were together with the strains from foci around the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Foci A and B are adjacent to the Central Asia foci. Due to the lack of strains outside China in this study, it is impossible to provide a detailed and integrated relationship between the strains in Xinjiang and those of the Central Asia. However, we can confirm that there is a long genetic distance between strains of Foci A, B and other domestic strains isolated in China. To date, all the strains from Foci L and M belonged to biovar Microtus, except for one imported strain (N010024). Microtus is a newly-identified biovar that is phenotypically and genotypically different from the other three biovars []. Our results showed that A could not only differentiate between Microtus and the other three biovars, but also divided the Microtus strains into two subclusters containing strains from foci L and M respectively. Five loci (M61, ms01, M58, M49 and M37) showed differences between the two subclusters. These loci could be used in the subsequent studies focused on Microtus strains. In November 2005, five cases of severe pneumonia of unknown causes were reported in Yulong, Yunnan province, resulting in two deaths. These cases were subsequently diagnosed as plague, and the natural plague focus was confirmed by field investigation. Five strains of in China. The Yulong focus has distinct geographical features: it is adjacent to Focus E, and both of these foci are in the longitudinal valley area of Western Yunnan, located at the southeast edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The two foci are also near Foci C and  The cluster analysis and  results suggested that the Yulong strains show a closer genetic relationship with the strains from Focus C than those from Focus E, as is consistent with the results of biological character comparisons []. Therefore, it was predicted that the Yulong strains were more likely to be a new branch that evolved from Focus C, rather than the result of expansion and spread of Focus  The Yulong natural plague focus is adjacent to the previously-discovered Jianchuan focus (Focus E). Their natural conditions are the same, but the R characteristics of strains from the two foci are critically different, suggesting that the two foci have relatively independent properties because of the hindrance of an ecological barrier. The recent occurrence of \"severe pneumonia of unknown causes\" in Yulong suggests that plague in this region is a threat to the human population. Since plague has not occurred in the Jianchuan region for a long time, the public health authorities in that area should remain vigilant in monitoring potential plague outbreaks. A is a very powerful and reproducible genotyping method and it is promising to be used as a simple molecular tool for characterization and epidemiological studies of when being applied to a larger number of isolates. The 14 loci used in this study gave a high discriminatory power and successfully separated isolates of different biovars and from different natural plague foci. The strains isolated from a new focus, Yulong, Yunnan province had a unique A type, indicating a new clone group. The results of cluster analysis and  analysis suggest that the Yulong focus strains may have a close relationship with strains from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau plague focus.

To determine the origin of the virus associated with a measles outbreak in Menglian County, Yunnan Province, People&#x2019;s Republic of China, in 2009, we conducted genetic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses based on nucleoprotein (N) and hemagglutinin (H) gene sequences showed that these Menglian viruses were not closely related to sequences of any World Health Organization () reference strains representing the 23 currently recognized genotypes. The minimum nucleotide divergence between the Menglian viruses and the most closely related reference strain, genotype D7, was 3.3% for the N gene and 3.0% for the H gene. A search of the databases of GenBank, , and the Health Protection Agency Measles Nucleotide Surveillance showed that the Menglian viruses, together with the 2 older non-Menglian viruses, could be members of a new proposed measles genotype, d11. The new genotype designation will allow for better description of measles transmission patterns, especially in the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific regions. Measles virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded  virus in the family ). Although deaths attributed to measles have declined by 78% worldwide, from &#x2248;733,000 deaths in 2000 to &#x2248;164,000 in 2008, risk for illness and death from measles still exists in countries with poor routine vaccination coverage, and outbreaks are a threat in most of these countries (]). Outbreaks of measles continued to occur because of increased numbers of susceptible children, especially in areas with low routine vaccination coverage. At the end of 2009, a measles outbreak in Menglian County was reported to the National Measles Laboratory of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Menglian County is situated on the western side of Yunnan Province and shares a border with Myanmar. As part of routine surveillance activities, the measles outbreak was investigated. Cases were confirmed through detection of immunoglobulin (Ig) M, and virus isolates were obtained for genetic analysis. Staff members from the Yunnan Center for Disease Control and Prevention collected serum and throat swab or urine specimens from patients during the outbreak (14 from Myanmar and 16 from Menglian). Serum samples were collected from 9 Myanmar and 7 Menglian case-patients. Throat swabs or urine specimens, from the first 6 Menglian patients, were obtained according to the  procedures for laboratory diagnoses of measles and rubella virus infections () and transported to the National Measles Laboratory for processing by standard procedures. To confirm all suspected cases, we used  kits (Virion/Serion GmbH, W&#x;rzburg, Germany) to detect measles and rubella virus Ig Measles virus was isolated by using the Vero/hM cell line (). The robustness of the groupings was assessed by using bootstrap resampling of 1,000 replicates. During 2008&#x2013;2009, routine measles vaccine coverage in Menglian County was as high as 95%; the last local measles case before this outbreak had been reported in June 2008. The outbreak began when 14 persons from Myanmar became ill with fever and rash and sought healthcare in Menglian during October 10&#x2013;November 28, 2009. The first measles case in a person from Menglian occurred on November 5, 2009; the last occurred on December 20. On December 28, the number of measles cases from the outbreak totaled 14 persons from Myanmar and 16 from Menglian. Measles was confirmed by laboratory detection of IgM in all 16 patients from whom serum samples were available (9 from Myanmar and 7 from Menglian). No IgM against rubella virus was detected (). *For all patients, immunoglobulin M against measles was positive and against rubella virus was negative.&#x2028;&#x2020;Menglian, Menglian County, Yunnan Province, People&#x2019;s Republic of China.

The sequences of these viruses were not closely related to the sequences of any of the  reference strains that represented the 23 currently recognized genotypes. These sequences were closest to the sequence of the genotype D7 reference strain and the contemporary genotype D7 strains available from GenBank. The minimum nucleotide divergence between the Menglian viruses and the D7  reference strain (VictoriaS/16.85) was 3.3% for the N gene and 3.0% for the H gene (). A search of the databases of GenBank, , and the Health Protection Agency Measles Nucleotide Surveillance (). The Menglian measles viruses, together with the 2 closely related viruses, i//12.01 and s/UvbridgeR/19.04, should be considered as members of a newly proposed measles genotype, d11. i/MenglianunnanN/47.09 (GenBank accession nos.: N, 440571; H, 440576) was chosen as the reference strain because an isolate is available, it grows to high titer in cell culture, and the sequence is representative of the Menglian strains. Although designation as a genotype is not permanent until after the new genotype has been acknowledged and formally designated by , the percentage sequence divergence between the N and H gene sequences of the Menglian isolates and the sequences of the reference strains exceed the recommended threshold for designation of a new measles genotype, 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively (). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these viruses form a unique cluster compared with all previously characterized wild-type measles viruses. Because the Australia virus was imported from Myanmar and the sequence from the United Kingdom originated in a country adjacent to Myanmar, these sequences should be included as members of the proposed d11 genotype. The most useful criterion for a new genotype is that it must have some epidemiologic utility for describing the transmission pathways of measles virus. The Menglian viruses responsible for the measles outbreak in China represent strains that are probably associated with endemic transmission of virus in Myanmar. When we consider the sequence of the Australia virus, we believe that the genotype d11 measles virus might have been circulating in Myanmar since 2001. The d11 sequences are easily distinguished from the sequences of viruses in other genotypes (e.g., D8, D4, H1, D5, D9, G3) that are circulating in neighboring countries. Therefore, the Menglian viruses are providing baseline genetic information about viruses endemic to Myanmar and possibly neighboring countries. The new genotype designation will enable better description of measles transmission patterns, especially in the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific regions of . Molecular epidemiologic data, when analyzed in conjunction with standard epidemiologic data, can help document viral transmission pathways, identify whether a virus is endemic or imported, and aid in case classification, thus enhancing control and elimination programs (). However, rapidly identifying imported measles cases and controlling spread are major challenges for achieving this goal. Enhancing measles virus surveillance to quickly identify imported cases of measles will become more critical as measles elimination goals are achieved throughout the world.

This single-arm, open-label, Phase  study evaluated the efficacy and safety of single-agent bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, in Japanese patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Patients with histologically confirmed, measurable glioblastoma or World Health Organization Grade  glioma, previously treated with temozolomide plus radiotherapy, received 10 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival in the patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Of the 31 patients enrolled, 29 (93.5%) had glioblastoma and 2 (6.5%) had Grade  glioma. Eleven (35.5%) patients were receiving corticosteroids at baseline; 17 (54.8%) and 14 (45.2%) patients had experienced one or two relapses, respectively. The 6-month progression-free survival rate in the 29 patients with recurrent glioblastoma was 33.9% (90% confidence interval, 19.2&#x2013;48.5) and the median progression-free survival was 3.3 months. The 1-year survival rate was 34.5% with a median overall survival of 10.5 months. There were eight responders (all partial responses) giving an objective response rate of 27.6%. The disease control rate was 79.3%. Eight of the 11 patients taking corticosteroids at baseline reduced their dose or discontinued corticosteroids during the study. Bevacizumab was well-tolerated and Grade &#x2265;3 adverse events of special interest to bevacizumab were as follows: hypertension [3 (9.7%) patients], congestive heart failure [1 (3.2%) patient] and venous thromboembolism [1 (3.2%) patient]. One asymptomatic Grade 1 cerebral hemorrhage was observed, which resolved without treatment. Single-agent bevacizumab provides clinical benefit for Japanese patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Glioblastoma () is the most aggressive form of primary malignant brain tumor and the prognosis for patients with  is poor (). Therefore, new treatment strategies for recurrent  are needed. An alternative therapeutic approach is the inhibition of angiogenesis through the vascular endothelial growth factor (F), a key regulator of angiogenesis. High levels of F are expressed in  cells (). Given the current evidence for bevacizumab in recurrent  in Western patient populations, we investigated the efficacy and safety of single-agent bevacizumab in a Phase , single-arm, open-label study (22506) in Japanese patients with recurrent malignant glioma. The trial was carried out in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki; all patients provided written informed consent prior to any study-related procedure. The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centers. The study was registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center-Clinical Trials Information (Japic), trial number: Japic-090841. Eligible patients were aged &#x2265;20 years with histologically confirmed  or World Health Organization () Grade  glioma, the latter being reconfirmed at the time of surgery for recurrent glioma. Patients had magnetic resonance imaging ()-confirmed disease recurrence or progression with measurable lesions within 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment and no evidence of acute or subacute cerebral hemorrhage and had received prior  and  for malignant glioma. Other key inclusion criteria were a Karnofsky performance status () &#x2265;70%, a life expectancy of &#x2265;3 months and adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function (i.e. absolute neutrophil count &#x2265;1500/mm, hemoglobin &#x2265;10 g/dl, bilirubin &#x2264; 1.5 &#xD7; the upper limit of normal (), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase &#x2264; 2.5 &#xD7; , serum creatinine &#x2264; 1.25 &#xD7; ). The following minimum intervals of time must have elapsed between the termination of therapies and the start of bevacizumab treatment:  8 weeks; surgical therapy and incisional biopsy 4 weeks; endocrine therapy and immunotherapy 3 weeks; post-traumatic intervention (except for patients with non-healing wounds) 2 weeks; transfusion and the use of hematopoietic growth factors 2 weeks; aspiration cytology and needle biopsy 1 week; nitrosoureas 6 weeks, procarbazine 3 weeks, vincristine 2 weeks and other chemotherapies 4 weeks and other investigational new drugs and unapproved drugs 4 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had: prior treatment with bevacizumab; a history of treatment with carmustine wafers, stereotactic radiotherapy, proton therapy or neutron capture therapy; &#x2265;3 prior regimens for malignant glioma and inadequately controlled hypertension, heart disease, symptomatic cerebrovascular disorder, gastrointestinal () perforation, fistula or abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to enrollment. This single-arm, open-label, Phase  study was conducted at 10 sites in Japan. One cycle of treatment was defined as one bevacizumab infusion administered on Day 1 every 2 weeks. Eligible patients received 10 mg/kg bevacizumab as an intravenous infusion administered over 90 (&#xB1;15) min on Day 1 of each cycle, which could be reduced to 30 min by Cycle 3 if no infusion reactions occurred. Treatment continued until disease progression () or unacceptable toxicity. Bevacizumab doses were adjusted only for changes of &#x2265;10% in body weight during the study. In the event of unacceptable toxicity, bevacizumab treatment was delayed or discontinued according to pre-specified criteria. Bevacizumab was discontinued if multiple adverse events (s) fulfilling the pre-specified delay or discontinuation criteria occurred in the same cycle, if cerebral hemorrhage occurred and if delayed treatment could not be restarted within 6 weeks of the last bevacizumab infusion. Patients who discontinued bevacizumab were followed for survival. Bevacizumab was provided by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). The primary endpoint was 6-month  in patients with recurrent  only. Six-month  was defined as the percentage of patients who remained alive and progression free at 24 weeks and was chosen based on published evidence demonstrating its extrapolation to the overall survival () (). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the 1-year survival, , objective response rate (), duration of response (),  and disease control rate (). Efficacy was assessed every third cycle (i.e. Cycles 3, 6, 9 etc.). Progression and objective response were determined by comprehensive evaluation of the results from  scans, corticosteroid dose assessment and neurocognitive function assessment. They were assessed by an independent radiology facility () by reference to Macdonald's Criteria (). Response was classified according to the following categories: complete response (), partial response (), no change () and  Confirmation of the response was determined on two consecutive assessments &#x2265;4 weeks apart: patients who were determined as having  or  were defined as responders; patients who were determined as having  or  were defined as non-responders. Percentage tumor shrinkage was also assessed and was calculated from the sum of the products of the diameters () at baseline and the smallest  after baseline. s were assessed throughout the study and were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for s version 3.0 (). Body weight, vital signs and laboratory tests were assessed prior to the start of each cycle. The efficacy analysis population comprised all patients with recurrent . Patients with Grade  glioma were also evaluated for efficacy, but were not included in the primary analysis. All patients were evaluated for safety. Statistical analysis to detect a 6-month  of 35% was established based on data from previous studies [ study [24] (42.6% with bevacizumab monotherapy) and the -06-C-0064E study [26] (29% with bevacizumab monotherapy)], in which a 15% threshold for 6-month  was defined. Under these conditions, 28 patients with recurrent  would provide at least 80% power to detect a 20% increase in 6-month  from 15 to 35% at the 5% one-sided significance level. Assuming that other  Grade  glioma patients would be enrolled, the overall target sample size was 32 patients. The 6-month , median ,  and  were calculated by the Kaplan&#x2013;Meier method and confidence intervals (s) calculated by Greenwood's formula (). Exact binomial s were used for estimated intervals for response rates. Between August 2009 and July 2010, 31 patients were enrolled, 29 of whom were included in the efficacy analysis population. All enrolled patients received a median of 6 bevacizumab doses. Treatment was discontinued in a total of 25 patients: 23 (74.2%) due to ; 2 (6.5%) due to s. Efficacy and safety analyses, except for , were performed after an observation period of &#x2265;6 months (data cut-off 7 January 2011); the  analyses, which included data collected through to 22 August 2011, were performed after all enrolled patients had been observed for &#x2265;1 year.

Six-month  and  by subgroup in patients with recurrent  Adverse events &#x2265;Grade 3 and adverse events of special interest to bevacizumab A total of 22 (71.0%) patients experienced s of special interest to bevacizumab, comprising proteinuria, hemorrhage, hypertension, congestive heart failure and venous thromboembolism (Table&#xA0;). One Grade 1 cerebral hemorrhage was observed on ; this was asymptomatic and resolved without treatment. Five (16.1%) patients had Grade 3 s of special interest to bevacizumab, comprising congestive heart failure [1 (3.2%) patient], venous thromboembolism [1 (3.2%) patient] and hypertension [3 (9.7%) patients]. No patients reported the other s of special interest to bevacizumab, i.e. reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, wound-healing complications,  perforation or fistulae. Abnormal laboratory results were reported in 74.2% of patients. The most common abnormal laboratory result was proteinuria, which was reported in 41.9% of patients. Abnormal laboratory results classed as &#x2265;Grade 3 were observed in two patients, reported as neutropenia and leukopenia. This is the first clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-agent bevacizumab in Japanese patients with recurrent . Our data demonstrated that single-agent bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was effective in terms of the 6-month , ,  and 1-year survival, and was well tolerated in this Japanese population. In addition, the majority [21 (72.4%)] of patients with recurrent  experienced some tumor shrinkage during the treatment period. The observed 6-month  of 33.9% and  of 27.6% seen in our study were more favorable than previous published data. These data are numerically higher than those reported for other studies with other chemotherapy and/or  regimens (6-month  9&#x2013;21% and  4&#x2013;9%) (). The use of Macdonald's Criteria was standard when this study was initiated; however, subsequently the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (O) Working Group has recommended assessing  T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery () of non-enhancing lesions in addition to enhancing lesions (). As the Macdonald's Criteria only assess contrast-enhancing lesions, there are risks that pseudoprogression and pseudoresponses may be considered real treatment effects. In our study an  assessed the changes in the T2/ signal, which was not included in the primary response evaluation based on Macdonald's Criteria. No significant increase in the T2/ signal was confirmed in the eight responders for the , and seven out of eight responders exhibited &#x2265;6 months' . Based on these results, we are convinced that the objective response seen in our study is not a pseudoresponse. Of the 29  patients treated, 21 exhibited tumor shrinkage, including 8 patients who had a  and 13 &#x2018;non-responders&#x2019; who were determined as  or  but exhibited some benefit with bevacizumab that was not captured by the response criteria; the maximum percentage of tumor shrinkage in 6 patients was &gt;50%. The apparent discrepancy between the number of responders and the number of patients with tumor shrinkage is likely to be due to the ways in which the endpoints are calculated. The percentage of tumor shrinkage is calculated from the  at baseline and the smallest  after baseline, whereas for a patient to be classed as a responder, there had to be a decrease in tumor volume by &#x2265;50% in the product of two diameters according to confirmation  performed &#x2265;4 weeks after an observed response, as well as no increase in corticosteroid dosage and no neurologic deterioration. This leads to the difference between the number of patients with tumor shrinkage and the number of responders. The 6-month  and  results were better for patients who had experienced one relapse than for those who had experienced two relapses, which is the same as a previously published observation () was powered to detect a statistical difference in these subgroups, the results could suggest that earlier administration of bevacizumab, or treatment with bevacizumab in younger patients, may lead to better tumor response and is something that requires investigation in further clinical trials. Regarding the survival endpoints, our study showed results that were better than previously published data. The median  of 10.5 months in  patients and 9.4 months in all patients was longer than that reported in other  trials (5.0&#x2013;7.3 months) (). In addition to the favorable efficacy measures, a trend was also observed where 8 of the 11 patients who were taking corticosteroids at baseline were able to reduce their dose or discontinue corticosteroids altogether during the course of the study. This is consistent with other findings that suggest that bevacizumab may have corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with recurrent  (). Corticosteroid reduction may reduce infection rates and other related toxicities and therefore is expected to improve the health-related quality of life for patients. Bevacizumab was well tolerated in our study and the incidence of s of special interest to bevacizumab was similar to that seen in other published studies with single-agent bevacizumab (). No new bevacizumab safety signals were seen in this Japanese population. In our study, and in the other single-agent bevacizumab studies ()) in which the addition of bevacizumab to standard of care (concurrent  plus  followed by adjuvant ) is being evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed . There are many novel targeted agents under investigation for the treatment of gliomas (); however, results with these new agents have been disappointing to date. Single-target agents alone may not be able to prevent tumor growth given the multiple pathways involved in many intracellular processes of tumor development. A key to future improvements in the treatment of gliomas will be the combination of other chemotherapeutic agents or molecular targeted therapies with bevacizumab to block these multiple pathways. This potential approach needs to be explored in future clinical trials. In conclusion, the results of this study show that single-agent bevacizumab could provide significant clinical benefit for Japanese patients with recurrent . This work was supported by .

Radiation therapy following the initial surgical debulking procedure of the  represents one of the most effective postoperative treatment modalities. The volume of tumor treated has ranged from lower dose whole brain irradiation to higher dose focal tumor irradiation over the past thirty years in order to reduce the likelihood of normal tissue damage. Despite whole brain irradiation, most patients progress near or within the original tumor location. The primary goal in the treatment planning stage is to emphasize the dose delivery to the tumor volume while sparing the normal tissue []. Previous studies have demonstrated that the vast majority of patterns of failure following radiation were within the high dose in-field suggesting local tumor recurrence in close proximity to the primary tumor site []. Therefore, we investigated whether this intensification of therapy with biological agents altered the pattern of failure in patients with .

Three patients completed 3 or 4&#xA0;cycles at the time of analysis without tumor progression or toxicity. Five patients had grade 2 or 3 hypertension that was managed by oral medications. Twelve of the 23 patients experienced a tumor recurrence (Figure&#xA0;).

The symptoms included a change in mental status, new weakness of a limb, speech changes, and headaches. The tumor recurrences occurred between 132&#x2013;560&#xA0;days postoperatively (median: 256&#xA0;days). The earliest recurrence occurred within 84&#xA0;days postoperatively outside of the high dose , which is not consistent with pseudoprogression. The tumor recurrence of two patients was noted on  prior to the initiation of symptoms 256 and 285&#xA0;days postoperatively, respectively. However, both of these patients began experiencing symptoms within 3&#xA0;weeks of imaging progression, and one died within one month of new symptoms. Angiogenesis is necessary for the development of macroscopic neoplasia []. Both  and  are recognized to provide clinical benefits for  patients []. Based on these observations, investigators have studied the addition of  to the standard radiation and  regimen. Lai and colleagues treated patients with external beam radiation of 60.0&#xA0;Gy after the surgery concurrently with  and  []. The median follow-up of the present study was 12&#xA0;months. While the median overall survival was not reached, the 6&#xA0;month progression-free survival was promising (87%). In the current study, combined therapy of radiation in conjunction with  and  to treat  proved successful with minimal toxicity. Four patients discontinued therapy due to toxicity for the following: bone marrow suspension (2), craniotomy wound infection (1), and pulmonary embolus (1). Five patients had grade 2 or 3 hypertension that was managed by oral medications. The determination of tumor progression in this study was based on new T1 Gadolinium enhancement or T2  progression, based on the O criteria []. A biopsy was not performed due to the risk of complications as well as potential delay in additional anti- therapy. The risk of an unfavorable neurosurgical event outweighed the benefit of conducting a biopsy as prior  increases complications. Ten of the 12 patients who experienced a tumor recurrence had clinical symptoms prior to tumor progression detected on . These new symptoms included a change in mental status, new weakness of a limb, speech changes, and headaches. Two of the 12 patients with a tumor recurrence denied any symptoms prior to the tumor detection on . However, both of these patients began experiencing symptoms within 3&#xA0;weeks of imaging progression, and one died within one month of new symptoms. As the radiation treatment of  has evolved, investigators have analyzed the patterns of failure to determine whether the target volume margin was sufficient or whether it requires redefinition prior to subsequent trials []. Taken together, these studies suggest that radiation dose escalation alone is unlikely to produce clinical benefit for  patients. Two recent trials have randomized patients to the standard radiation and  regiment with or without  to help determine whether upfront  provides clinical benefit.

Etirinotecan pegol (R-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to 38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan. This randomized phase  trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma. A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (s). The primary end point was objective response rate () by  (version 1.0). Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of , progression-free survival (), and overall survival (). The overall confirmed  was 20% (95% , 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days. Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days. Median  for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median  was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively. Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 s being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%). Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days. Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging  and  rates. The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer  and  rates. The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase  study and is preferred for future phase  studies. These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.", "4161529": "An antiangiogenic approach is especially suitable for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Recently, two large clinical trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (the Avastin in Glioblastoma study and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0825 study) showed a 3- to 4-month prolongation of progression-free survival () with bevacizumab, but no significant effect on overall survival (). Japan is the first, and so far only, country to approve the use of bevacizumab in newly diagnosed glioblastoma in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. The drug is also approved for use as monotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma and certain other types of high-grade glioma after previous therapy. The effectiveness of bevacizumab on Japanese malignant glioma patients was reviewed. The Phase  clinical trial demonstrated that the  with bevacizumab alone was 34% at 6 months and 3.3 months at median for 32 patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. In the Avastin in Glioblastoma study, 44 Japanese patients were registered from Japan.  and  for bevacizumab combined with standard temozolomide and radiotherapy were 12.2 months and 29.2 months at median, respectively, for the patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  and  tended to be longer for those treated with bevacizumab than for those not treated with the drug. In addition, biomarkers of bevacizumab effectiveness were investigated in Japanese patients. Vascular endothelial growth factor concentration, matrix metalloproteinase 9 activities in urine, and apparent diffusion coefficient values on magnetic resonance imaging may be biomarkers that predict patient prognosis. Finally, novel experiments for vascular endothelial growth factor antibody action were described; these include the induction of glioma cell apoptosis, an antibody treatment failure model, and a study of the synergistic effect with chemotherapeutic agents. Glioblastoma is one of the most richly neovascularized solid tumors in terms of vasoproliferation, endothelial cell hyperplasia, and endothelial cell cytology; hence, an antiangiogenic approach may be especially suitable for the treatment of malignant gliomas. However, Japan is the first, and so far only, country to approve the use of bevacizumab in newly diagnosed glioblastoma in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. The drug is also approved for use as a monotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma and for certain other types of high-grade gliomas after previous therapy. In this paper, the effectiveness of bevacizumab in Japanese patients with malignant glioma was reviewed from basic research to clinical trial and from some new findings. Immunolocalization of vascular endothelial growth factor (F) was investigated in the brain tumors of 19 Japanese patients; the types of tumors included glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, low-grade astrocytoma, meningioma, malignant lymphoma, and metastatic brain tumor. Normal brain tissue was also examined.). Using a F enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we determined the concentration of F in the serum and tumor extracts of 19 brain tumor patients, just as we did in the immunohistochemical study.). Although the F concentration in the serum was not correlated with that in the tissue, the F concentration of glioblastoma cyst fluid was 200&#x2013;300-fold higher than that in the serum of the patients. F concentration in the tumors was significantly correlated with the vascularity measured by counting the vessels stained with von Willebrand factor antibody. There was a significant correlation between tissue concentration and a positive rate of expression of  In another series, human malignant glioma samples (24 glioblastomas, 13 anaplastic astrocytomas) were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0; The protein expression of the most potent angiogenic factor, F, and its specific natural inhibitor, soluble Flt-1 (data not shown), was measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, , ).). These results demonstrate that F is localized in tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells in glioma, especially in glioblastoma, and its concentration predicts malignant glioma survival. Antiangiogenesis properties and tumor growth inhibition were proven on an experimental human glioma xenograft model.). This combined effect of U and F antibody treatment for U87  growth and survival was also confirmed with the intracerebral model. The median survival times after implantation were 34.0&#xB1;1.9 days (control group), 41&#xB1;1.9 days (U group), 45.0&#xB1;4.1 days (F antibody group), and 52.8&#xB1;5.5 days (U plus F antibody group). Combination therapy significantly prolonged the survival of the mice bearing intracerebral U87  (=0.0006; Mantel&#x2013;Cox log&#x2013;rank test). -1 positivities and vessel densities for each group are shown in &lt;0.001). Further study was conducted by investigating the direct action of the F antibody on the glioma cell. F receptor ()2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor essential for F-mediated physiological responses in endothelial cells. Traditionally, the s were thought to be almost exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. Recent studies, however, suggest that tumor-derived F provides not only paracrine survival cues for endothelial cells, but they may also fuel autocrine processes in glioblastoma cells (tumor-secreted F provides prosurvival signaling through s expressed by the tumor cells themselves). We investigated the mechanism of F blockade using the F antibody for glioma cells. Three glioma cell lines, U87, U251, and T98G, revealed the expression of 1 and 2 in addition to  2 expression was upregulated under hypoxic conditions with F expression (). The experiment was repeated three times. One mechanism by which the F antibody blockades the autocrine F&#x2013; system is the induction of apoptosis on glioma cells; this was demonstrated under both hypoxic conditions and normoxic ones. Anti-F treatment induced a more than sevenfold increase in the percentage of apoptotic endothelial cells in the thyroid glands of healthy mice. Taken together, autocrine F blockade on glioma cells are considered an important part of tumor growth inhibition through the induction of apoptosis. Given the current evidence for bevacizumab effectiveness for recurrent glioblastomas in Western patient populations, Between August 2009 and July 2010, 31 patients were enrolled, 29 of whom were included in the efficacy analysis population. Patients with histologically confirmed, measurable glioblastoma or World Health Organization grade 3 glioma, previously treated with temozolomide plus radiotherapy, received a 10 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was 6-month  in the patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Of the 31 patients enrolled, 29 (93.5%) had glioblastoma and two (6.5%) had grade 3 glioma. All enrolled patients received a median of six bevacizumab doses. Treatment was discontinued in a total of 25 patients: 23 (74.2%) due to progressed disease; and two (6.5%) due to adverse effects. Efficacy and safety analyses, except for , were performed after an observation period of 6 months (data cutoff: January 7, 2011); the  analyses, which included data collected through to August 22, 2011, were performed after all enrolled patients had been observed for 1 year. The 6-month  rate in the 29 patients with recurrent glioblastoma (primary endpoint) was 33.9% (90% confidence interval [], 19.2&#x2013;48.5), and this exceeded the 15% threshold (). There were eight responders (all partial responses) giving an objective response rate (Macdonald criteria) of 27.6%. Five patients (16.1%) had grade 3 adverse effects of special interest to bevacizumab. One patient (3.2%) had congestive heart failure, one patient (3.2%) had venous thromboembolism, and three patients (9.7%) had hypertension. Bevacizumab was well tolerated in our study, and the incidence of adverse effects of special interest to bevacizumab was similar to that seen in other published studies of single-agent bevacizumab. No new bevacizumab safety concerns were seen in this Japanese population. This is the first clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-agent bevacizumab in Japanese patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Our data demonstrated that 10 mg/kg of single-agent bevacizumab was effective in terms of the 6-month , the objective response rate, as well as with respect to the  and 1-year survival rate, and it was well tolerated in this Japanese population. Prior to this Phase  study, we investigated the cohort study for the efficacy of bevacizumab on recurrent glioblastoma at a single institution; we especially focused on the response on magnetic resonance imaging () findings. The antiedema and antiangiogenic effects of bevacizumab were evaluated using the apparent diffusion coefficient () of peritumoral edema associated with the regional cerebral blood volume (r) of the tumor. Ten patients with recurrent glioblastoma after temozolomide and radiation treatment were treated by bevacizumab every 2 weeks for 4&#x2013;36 months (average: 12 months). An  was performed every 2 months. On each , the  value, the Gd-enhanced area on the T1 image, the area of peritumoral edema on the T2 image, and the r on the perfusion image were measured.  and r values were determined by the use of regions of interest positioned in areas of high signal intensities, as seen on T2-weighted images and  maps. The Gd-enhanced area (Macdonald method), the T2 high-intensity area (Macdonald method), the  value, and the r value were measured at pretreatment, 2 months after treatment, and 4 months after treatment for each case. After 2 months with bevacizumab treatment, the  and r values decreased 49% and 32%, respectively; this was associated with a markedly smaller Gd-enhanced area compared to pretreatment. After 4 months, six of ten cases (group A) sustained diminished  values (2 months, 45.8%&#xB1;8.1% and 4 months, 46.4%&#xB1;8.6%) and r values (2 months, 28.5%&#xB1;36.1% and 4 months, 24.8%&#xB1;24.7%). After 4 months, four of ten cases (group B) revealed elevated  values (2 months, 54.8%&#xB1;19.7% and 4 months, 91.3%&#xB1;10.3%) and r values (2 months, 46.3%&#xB1;5.3% and 4 months, 76.3%&#xB1;19.4%). Two representative cases of group A were shown in . For groups A and B,  and  were determined. The median  in group A was significantly longer than that in group B (27.9 months and 3.0 months, respectively; &lt;0.05). These results indicate that the antiedema and antiangiogenic effects of bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma, demonstrated by the decreased  and r values, was dramatic and prolonged  for 4 months despite tumor progression. Most importantly, the  and r values predicted the effectiveness of bevacizumab on recurrent glioblastoma in terms of patient prognosis, particularly after an observation period of 4 months. An observation period of 2 months is not sufficient. A fraction of patients with cancer, including glioblastoma, are refractory to F-inhibitor treatment. We investigated the target molecule for bevacizumab treatment resistance in clinical cases and in an experimental model.). The gelatinolytic activity of s was evident as a clear band of lysis against the blue background of stained gelatin gel. Gelatin zymogram can differentiate active from inactive forms and detect the complex form with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases of gelatinases.  activities in the urine appeared as only 2 in pretreatment; it disappeared during the weeks 1, 2, 6 and 12, and appeared as both 2 and 9 at 20 weeks. The time course of  activities was well correlated with the clinical course of bevacizumab usage. In another case,  activities in urine were similar to the 9 activity that appeared during tumor progression (data not shown). For further study, an animal model of bevacizumab failure was examined. For in vivo animal experiments, green fluorescent protein-labeled U87 glioblastoma cells (5&#xD7;10). The pathological upregulation of 9 in this animal experiment and upregulation of urine 9 activities in these animal experiments and these clinical cases indicated that the invasive phenotype that develops after long-term bevacizumab treatment could be related to elevated levels of 9 activity. The signals that regulate angiogenesis in primary tumors are distinct from those that are active in invasive tumors. Recently, a novel glioma model has been used to demonstrate, histologically, two distinct patterns of invasion &#x2013; namely, angiogenesis-dependent invasion with the overexpression of angiogenesis-related genes such as those for F, 9, hypoxia-inducible factor 1, and platelet-derived growth factor, and angiogenesis-independent invasion with overexpression of invasion-related genes such as those for integrin alpha-v beta-3, 2, nestin, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine. Although antiangiogenic therapies for malignant gliomas are promising, the duration of response with available regimens is modest. As yet, there are no effective treatments for patients undergoing antiangiogenic therapies in whom the tumor progresses. Further understanding of the mechanisms and early detection of resistance to antiangiogenic therapies, such as through urinary  activity and serum  levels, will be crucial for improvement in patients with malignant glioma. Recently, two well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized trials &#x2013; the glio trial and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0825 trial The two trials were nearly identical in terms of design, patient characteristics, and the primary endpoints of  and  The consistency between the trial designs was mirrored by the consistency between the primary outcomes, with both trials showing a 3- to 4-month prolongation of  with bevacizumab, but no significant effect of the drug on  Although survival remains the standard by which efficacy is measured, clinical benefit, measured by such variables as quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes, can potentially be used as a criterion for United States Food and Drug Administration approval of a new therapy for cancer. The glio trial showed that bevacizumab improved or prolonged maintenance of quality of life and performance status. This means a strong argument can be made for the drug&#x2019;s use as part of the initial treatment of glioblastoma regardless of its effect on survival. With regard to the glio study, 44 patients from Japan were registered in the study. Bevacizumab&#x2019;s efficacy and safety were presented by Nakamura et al (Kumamoto University) at the 2013 annual meeting of the Japan Society of Neuro-Oncology. A total of 19 patients were assigned to the bevacizumab group and 25 patients to the placebo group. The median  was longer in the bevacizumab group than in the placebo group (12.2 months versus 8.7 months, respectively; stratified hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.71; 95% , 0.35&#x2013;1.44;  By contrast, in the Japanese population, only four among 25 patients (16%) in the placebo group received bevacizumab at the time of recurrence, because bevacizumab was not approved for recurrent glioblastoma at that time in Japan. Baseline health-related quality of life was maintained longer in the bevacizumab group than in the control group. In the bevacizumab group, grade 3 or higher adverse events associated with bevacizumab were observed: hypertension in five out of 19 patients (26.5%); and proteinuria in three out of 19 patients (15.8%). Other bevacizumab-specific adverse events such as intracerebral bleeding, intratumoral bleeding, and venous thromboembolism were not recognized. The researchers concluded that the additive effect of bevacizumab on newly diagnosed glioblastoma is considerable, but limited by tolerable safety. A representative long-term glioblastoma survivor with glio study is presented from our institution. A 65-year-old man with a newly diagnosed left parietal glioblastoma was registered in the glio study. After partial removal and concomitant temozolomide and 60 Gy radiation therapy, temozolomide and bevacizumab maintenance therapy started in March 2010. Partial response was seen in serial s. However, temozolomide and bevacizumab therapy were discontinued at the seventh cycle of bevacizumab monotherapy in November 2011 because of grade 3 thrombocytopenia, grade 2 hypertension, and grade 2 proteinuria. The tumor was well controlled until regrowth on July 2012, and the patient had a good Karnofsky performance score of 70%.  was 28 months. Stereotactic radiation (3 Gy &#xD7;13 times) was administered, but tumor growth control was insufficient and the patient died in June 2013.  was 39 months. Because he survived for more than 3 years, he is considered a long-term glioblastoma survivor. Interestingly, in this case, the bevacizumab-specific adverse effects of hypertension and proteinuria were observed during therapy. This case shows that hypertension and proteinuria may be effective biomarkers in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who are treated with bevacizumab, just as they are in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In particular, it may be associated with a favorable effect on disease control, 6-month , and median  Japan is the first, and so far only, country to approve the use of bevacizumab in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The drug is also approved for use as a monotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma and for certain other types of high-grade glioma after previous therapy. The Japanese approval was based on the glio study, the Phase   study, and a Japanese Phase  study (22506). F was highly expressed in glioblastoma. The F concentration in tissue, but not in the serum, predicted the survival of the patients with malignant glioma; those with F concentrations &gt;1,000 pg/mg had poor prognoses. Bevacizumab with and without U inhibited glioma growth and angiogenesis in experimental glioma.  with bevacizumab alone was 34% at 6 months and 3.3 months at median for the patients with recurrent malignant glioma. 9 and -1 were important molecules for bevacizumab failure (for example, invasive phenotype). Urine 9 may be a useful biomarker for bevacizumab failure. Bevacizumab decreased  values and r values on s even after glioma progression.  and  with bevacizumab combined with standard temozolomide and radiotherapy were 12.2 months and 29.2 months at median, respectively, for the patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  and  tended to be longer for those treated with bevacizumab than for those not treated with the drug.

The amplified  products were gel purified using quick Gel Extraction Kit () and bidirectionally sequenced with corresponding primers on an   3130 Automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the GeneLab core facility in the School of Veterinary Medicine at . In several cases where direct sequencing failed, purified  products were cloned into p2.1-O (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Plasmid inserts were sequenced by the  Gene Lab using the M13 forward (-20) and M13 reverse (-24) primer pairs. Raw reads from each strain were subsequently assembled de novo to the level of contig using Mira v3.4.1.1 under default settings, except the number of passes was set to 4, &#x201C;skim each pass&#x201D; was enabled, and minimum read length was set to 50. Homology searches (vs. I&#x2019;s  database) were used to partition the contigs into rickettsial and nonrickettsial sequences. Additionally, reads from each  strain were mapped to full-length 16S r sequences in the GreenGenes database from May 2013 (v. 13_5) using the long-read option of  v0.5.9, and binned by taxonomy to assess the microbial diversity in each sample.

Utilizing FastOrtho, an in-house modified version of Ortho (). Generated s were used in various analyses, as further outlined below. To estimate a robust phylogeny of Rickettsiaceae, 310 perfect s (exactly one  from each taxon of Rickettsiaceae) were selected for analysis. Multiple sequence alignment of each  was performed using  (default parameters) () under the &#x2013;general time reversible () model, with the bipartition frequencies analyzed at various time points using the bpcomp program. For tree-building, appropriate burn-in values were determined by plotting the log likelihoods for each chain over sampled generations (time). Analyses were considered complete when the maximum difference in bipartition frequencies between the two chains was less than 0.1. Ultimately, a burn-in value of 1,000, with sampling every two trees, was used to build a consensus tree. Comparative analysis of the three  genomes.

Comparative analysis of the four ). A gamma model of rate heterogeneity was used with estimation of the proportion of invariable sites. Branch support was assessed with 1,000 bootstrap pseudoreplications. An additional contig, c6440, within the assembly of  plasmids was performed using Mauve as described above. Several proteins encoded on c6440 were selected for further analysis.

Two proteins homologous to  transporters of -like T1s were combined with homologs retrieved from  analyses as described for 1016, with a similar protocol for phylogeny estimation. Finally, the large toxin encoded immediately upstream of the -like T1 ( 38) was analyzed using  searches against the  database.

On pLbaR, immediately upstream of the -like T1 operon lies a gene ( 38) encoding a large protein of 3,241 aa, hereafter referred to as pLbaR_38 ().

The tick requires a minimum temperature of about 6&#xB0;C for adequate survival, and when temperatures drop below this value, it may hibernate during winter, sheltered in the cracks of kennels and buildings. Ticks also require a certain level of humidity, which is provided by the high environmental moisture in the kennels (cleaned with water) or in gardens that receive artificial watering. Ticks are common and can reach significant population densities on riverbanks of the Mediterranean region, which are temperate and hold moisture. The tick is mainly active from spring to early autumn, when the highest infestations occur. The regional weather or the local conditions of some buildings may result in a different phenology or in different seasonal dynamics for the tick []. The impact of climate trends on the tick is unknown, although preliminary results have shown that their area of distribution is increasing, due to the increase in urbanized areas surrounding cities, and due to the warmer environment observed in autumn and winter at progressively higher latitudes. ].

The diagnostic usefulness of evaluating a blood smear depends on the pathogen species that has infected the dog. Ehrlichiosis and/or anaplasmosis can be diagnosed with the T or  []. Some commercial in-house dot- kits are qualitative, and show only a positive or negative result, without providing the dog&#x2019;s antibodies levels. Other dot- kits are semi-quantitative and provide some information on antibody levels. However, an accurate, reliable serological diagnosis is limited by the lack of standardization among different diagnostic laboratories and tests. A positive serologic result indicates a past or current infection, but it does not always denote an ongoing disease condition. A single positive titer result may only reflect a past infection that may be resolved, because antibody titers may persist for several months or years []. Presently, we recommend performing molecular tests to support any positive serological case, because the presence of bacterial  is a sign of active infection.

The use of non-specific primers and low annealing temperatures in some  assays can result in non-specific amplification; thus, the evaluation may provide misleading, false-positive results. Finally, it must be kept in mind that false-negative results can also occur due to the absence of pathogens in the sample. For example, bacteremia may be intermittent in some dogs or in specific diseases (e.g., ]; or it may be absent, due to previous administration of antibiotics, such as doxycycline. Therefore, a negative  result should be interpreted as &#x201C;no detection of the tested pathogen- in the sample&#x201D;, rather than &#x201C;the sample is free of the tested pathogen&#x201D;. Thus, to improve the usefulness of  and obtain as much information as possible from the results, it is important to submit samples to reliable laboratories and to assess the results in combination with an evaluation of antibody titers, clinical signs, and abnormal laboratory findings.

The treatment of choice is doxycycline at 5 mg/kg twice daily or 10 mg/kg once daily for 4 weeks. This regime guarantees a complete response in the majority of cases []. Therefore, the more prolonged treatment of 4 weeks is recommended. Although clinical improvement is achieved in most cases, it can be difficult to ensure treatment effectiveness regarding the total elimination of ]. Doxycycline, unlike other tetracyclines, does not seem to cause enamel discoloration in puppies. Moreover, one of the most common side effects of tetracyclines, vomiting, can be eliminated by splitting the antibiotic dose into two half-doses every 12 h (q12h) or by administering the antibiotic after feeding. When the dog has liver problems, the use of doxycycline should be reconsidered. In any case, liver function tests should be performed before and during treatment; when liver parameters increase, the treatment regime should be stopped []. Other drugs have been historically used for treating . Chloramphenicol has been used in dogs under 1 year of age, but its use is not recommended when doxycycline is available. Imidocarb dipropionate has also been described as a potential treatment for ehrlichiosis in dogs []. Doxycycline (for 2-3 weeks) at the dosage described above for ]. When dogs with circulating ]. ]. In severe or chronic ehrlichiosis and/or anaplasmosis, other therapeutic agents or treatments may be needed, particularly for ]. In some cases of chronic ehrlichiosis, when aplasia of all cell lines occurs, other treatments have been used. For example, growth factors, like granulocyte colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin have been used; however, scientific evidence of effectiveness is scarce. One case of chronic ehrlichiosis was treated successfully with a combination of hematopoietic growth factors, low dose vincristine, doxycycline, and glucocorticoids []. Treatment of ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis should not be initiated with glucocorticoids combined with antibiotics. Steroids should only be considered when no satisfactory response is noticed, or when immune-mediated complications arise. ]. Doxycycline is an effective drug against ehrlichiosis and/or anaplasmosis in dogs []. However, the prognosis of dogs with the chronic severe form of ehrlichiosis is grave [/&#x3;L, &#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;33.5%, T&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;14.5 s, or K&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;4.75 mmol/L could each predict survival with a probability of 100%. When the clinical response in canine ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis is not rapid, or when clinical signs persist after treatment with doxycycline, the dog must be re-examined for other infectious diseases or diseases with similar clinical signs (neoplasia or immune-mediated diseases) []. Laboratory abnormalities in canine ehrlichiosis typically resolve in dogs after treatment with acute disease. In general, both the complete blood count and the alterations in serum protein electrophoresis should normalize within 10-15 days after therapy initiation []. Chronic changes, such as mild or moderate hyperglobulinemia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia may persist as long as the infectious agent has not been completely eliminated, or when some other associated conditions exist []. Quantification of acute phase proteins in serum has been assessed for its value in monitoring and evaluating the prognosis of dogs with ehrlichiosis. Although quantification of acute phase proteins may be a useful indicator of the clinical stage, it has no predictive value for the final clinical outcome []. Finally, it must be recognized that prior infections with ]. Similar to canine ehrlichiosis, after treating anaplasmosis, laboratory alterations in the complete blood cell count and in serum protein electrophoresis should be resolved in most dogs []. Thrombocytopenia in dogs infected with ]. Antibody titers may persist for months. Then, in most ]. Information regarding the persistence of ]. Information regarding antibody titers in dogs naturally infected with ].  testing, when conducted several weeks after termination of doxycycline treatment, allows clinicians to be more confident that the treatment has been effective and that the dog did not enter the subclinical stage []. Yet, it must be recognized that a negative  result does not guarantee that the animal is &#x201C;free of infection&#x201D; (see above). There are two goals for performing  some weeks after the completion of treatment. One is to minimize the probability of obtaining false-negative results, due to antibiotic effects on bacteremia. The second is to minimize the chance of detecting  of dead pathogens that continue to circulate during the treatment period []. In conclusion,  is useful for monitoring dogs treated for these diseases, because it can detect the presence of pathogen , regardless of the serologic antibody titers. However, although this technique is more sensitive than serology in confirming an infection, its effectiveness may be limited for detecting pathogens in subclinically infected dogs, because the organisms may circulate intermittently in peripheral blood. Therefore, a  analysis should not be considered a definitive method for conclusively excluding subclinical infection in clinically normal dogs that remain seropositive after treatment []. In general, most acutely ill dogs infected with ]. Re-infections of canine ehrlichiosis are possible, because no persistent or effective immunity develops to defend against re-infection with these pathogens []. It is not known whether a natural infection can provide long term protection against the development of clinical anaplasmosis. Re-infection following the therapeutic elimination of the organism has not been reported in dogs; however, in human medicine, one re-infection case was documented []. The possibility of  re-infections in dogs living in endemic areas and exposed to ticks has not been fully evaluated, but cannot be ruled out. The prevention of ehrlichiosis and/or anaplasmosis infections in dogs must be focused on tick control. Ticks of the  To appropriately control tick infestations in dogs requires knowledge of tick seasonality. This seasonality is usually strict under natural conditions, and each stage of the life cycle of the tick follows the previous stage with regularity. However, these patterns can be lost in areas with large infestations in a peridomestic environment. Under those conditions, all stages can be active simultaneously, due to the presence of several infestations in the kennel. Outdoor populations of  activity are prolonged. In the case of ]. Various antiparasitic treatments are registered in Europe that have activity against ticks and can be prescribed for dogs []. The specific product can be selected according to the preferences of use (collar, pour-on, or spot on) and the therapeutic needs for each case. Some compounds, such as the pyrethroids or some preparations of diazinon, are registered as repellents. Apart from appropriate epidemiological measures, the best prevention against dog tick infestation is based on the use of ectoparasiticides. In general, these are active molecules that act against ticks, and they must also provide some degree of appropriate control within a short period of time []. Currently, no commercial vaccines are available to protect against infections with ]. Information on canine ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis in Europe has significantly increased in the last few years. This guideline aimed to answer common questions of interest on the etiology, transmission, epidemiology, clinical signs, laboratory findings, diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis of infections caused by  spp. This guideline contributes to the understanding of the current status of these diseases on the European continent. However, these pathogens are spreading to new niches, and reports have described infections in many countries where they were not detected previously.

The colony was resuspended by vortexing or repetitive pipetting. The cellular suspension was heated to 95&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;min and then cooled to room temperature. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000&#xA0;g for 5&#xA0;min. The supernatant, containing , was used as the template for  amplification. For the A test, we utilized primers that flank the eight R regions (vrrA, vrrB1, vrrB2, vrrC1, vrrC2, 3, p1, p2) as described by previous study []. Each unique profile based on allelic combination was designated a unique A type (). The Bionumerics software package, version 4.0 (Applied Maths, Belgium) was used for  clustering analysis based on categorical coefficient, and minimum spanning tree algorithm was used to construct a minimum spanning tree () to determine phylogenetic pattern. The A data of isolates of other provinces in China and worldwide isolates were come from ). All experiments involving  including isolates from human, animal and environments were performed according to the General Requirements for Bio-safety ( 19489&#x2013;2008) and approved by the Biosafety Committee of Guizhou Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and were also approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Guizhou Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. All the 32 isolates of ). Among these isolates, 26 isolates were isolated from soil, with one from human, one from cattle, two from dog and two from water. According to the year of isolation, six isolates were isolated in 2006, with 13 from 2007, six from 2008, four from 2009, five from 2010 and two from 2011. Based on the origin of region, 21 isolates were from Prefecture Qianxinan with two from Anshun, five from Qiannan, two from Bijie and one from Tongren. A data of 32 isolates from Guizhou province and 76 worldwide distributed isolates belonging to 30 s ( R1 to 30), which includes 19 isolates (9 s) from 11 other provinces of China (Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Qingdao, Changping, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Henan, Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Hong-Kong) and 57 isolates (21 s) of 14 other countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Namibia, South-Africa, Thailand, Turkey, , , , and Zimbabwe) were used for comparison. The cluster tree based on isolates from Guizhou Province and worldwide distributed isolates showed they were divided into three clusters (Figure&#xA0;), designated A, B and  All the 32 isolates were distributed in cluster A, which were further divided into A1, A2, A3 and A4 sub-clusters.  G1 - G8 isolates of Guizhou Province and  R1-R4 isolates from India, Namibia and Turkey formed sub-cluster A1, in which isolates from Guizhou Province were relatively closely clustered. Sub-cluster A2 contains 18 isolates from Guizhou and Hubei Province of China, , South-Africa and Namibia. Isolates of  G13-G19 from Guizhou Province formed the sub-cluster A3, while sub-cluster A4 includes 42 isolates (26 s) from China (including Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Qingdao, Changping, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Henan, Gansu, Hongkong, Sichuan, Xinjiang Province) and other Countries, which included Asian countries such as Japan, Thailand and Indonesia and , Germany, Zimbabwe,  and Namibia. It also showed that isolates from most of the Asian countries were grouped in sub-cluster A4, in which isolates from Guizhou were closely clustered.

First, the relative infrequency of the disease limits accrual. Second, is the lack of reliable surrogate endpoints []. From a survival and imaging standpoint, trials can be designed to identify active agents in this space that are active and worthy of further investigation in early lines of treatment. Topoisomerase- I inhibitors, like irinotecan, have demonstrated some efficacy against  []. Diarrhea does still occur, but tends to be late onset and manageable with a strict diarrhea protocol. Importantly, both of these studies demonstrated encouraging objective response rates (29 and 20&#xA0;% respectively) in patients who had been exposed to multiple prior agents. Neither study enrolled patients with glioma. However, the  in heavily treated patients, prolonged exposure to -38, and favorable side effect profile made  an interesting candidate to study in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. In this pilot trial, we studied the tolerability and efficacy of  in patients with heavily pre-treated, bevacizumab refractory . The study was a prospective, single-arm phase  study conducted at Stanford University (01663012). It was approved by Stanford&#x2019;s institutional review board and all participants provided written informed consent. Patients were enrolled from August 2012 to May 2013. Adult (&gt;18&#xA0;years old) patients with recurrent high-grade glioma after the use of bevacizumab were eligible. High grade glioma included  grade  and  tumors with an astrocytic component. Though patients with oligo-astrocytomas were not excluded, no patients with this histology enrolled. All participants had undergone maximally feasible resection (in some cases, this was biopsy alone), standard chemo-radiation or stereotactic radiosurgery concurrent with chemotherapy, had a  of at least 50, and had evidence of progression after treatment with bevacizumab. There was no limit on the number of prior lines of therapy. All participants had evidence of adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function.

This study was powered to compare patients receiving  to a  at 1&#xA0;month of 5&#xA0;%. At the time of trial design, there was no clear historical control for post-bevacizumab patients receiving a non-bevacizumab based regimen. Planned enrollment was 20 eligible and evaluable patients, which provided 88&#xA0;% power to reject a (nominal) -6w rate of 5&#xA0;% at a one-sided significance level of 10&#xA0;%, if the true -6w rate was 25&#xA0;% or better.

In the majority of patients with diarrhea, this was a single episode of loose stool. One patient had  grade 3 diarrhea (this patient was not adherent to the diarrhea supportive care instructions), one patient an asymptomatic grade 3  elevation, and one patient developed grade 3 myelosuppression (pancytopenia). Toxicity led to dose reductions in 2 patients and ultimately, to study discontinuation in the patient who wasn&#x2019;t able to adhere to supportive care instructions.

While the  and -6 are similar to those seen in recent trials in this population, the imaging response rate of 18&#xA0;% in  patients significantly exceeds the 2&#xA0;% overall response rate seen in prior trials (at 5&#xA0;% significance, 2 sided). Importantly, two of the responses were highly durable; both in primary  patients, one who was on study for 20&#xA0;months and the other who remains on study at 18&#xA0;months. Neither patient had a significant reduction in tumor volume on their first , but had slow decrease in volume over succeeding months. One patient with  on the 12&#xA0;week  improved slowly to meet  criteria over the course of 1&#xA0;year on study. If prolonged exposure to the topoisomerase inhibitor is required for response, it is possible that use of R-102 in an earlier setting, where patients have potential to receive more cycles of drug, may be more beneficial than in the very heavily pre-treated patient. Recently, Nowosielski et al. described four different types of tumor progression on  and correlated these with survival []. Median overall survival after  in their cohort was 2.9&#xA0;months, but patients with progression on  that was primarily see on the T2 scans or as a T1-post contrast flare up had median survivals of 4.8 and 4.6&#xA0;months, respectively. Participants in this study were not stratified by recurrence type. In post hoc analysis, the majority or our patients (14/20) had T2 diffuse or contrast flare-up recurrences. One of the long-term survivors had T2 progression only while the other had increased size in a contrast-enhancing lesion. The third patient in this study with radiographic response was a primary non-responder to . The 145&#xA0;mg/m every 3-week regimen of  was safe and well tolerated. The major concerns for compounds metabolized to -38 are diarrhea and myelosuppression. Only 2 patients (10&#xA0;%) in this heavily pre-treated cohort, developed grade 3 toxicity related to  that required clinical intervention. The patient with grade 3 diarrhea was non-adherent to the diarrhea protocol, which calls for the use of loperamide at the first loose stool. This patient was removed from the study 1&#xA0;month prior to tumor progression, but was censored at the off study date. While loose stool was a frequent complaint, it was easily manageable and did not cause significant dose reduction, delay, or distress in the majority of patients. We did not test for 1A mutations in this study, but this could be considered if further studies of  in glioma are planned. This study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy of  over alternative therapies. However, the three s noted in this small cohort coupled with the favorable safety profile make  an attractive candidate for further clinical investigation as a single agent in high-grade gliomas, and potentially, in brain metastases from -38 sensitive primary cancers. The combination of  and  is also intriguing.

The density of infected nymphs is determined by the density of nymphs * nymphal infection prevalence.

The aim of this review is to give an overview of the major multi-trophic (tick-rodent- ]. Factors affecting larval and nymphal host attachment are comparable and therefore combined in this paragraph.

Ectoparasites such as ticks affect the fitness of their hosts in various ways. For example, only 0.17&#xA0;% blood loss of gerbils (]. In addition, the heterogeneity in larval tick burdens on rodents can also be affected by the heterogeneous dispersal of larvae in the environment, increasing the chance of acquiring multiple larvae simultaneously. There is abundant evidence that pathogens can influence their host and/or vector to enhance transmission [infected ticks will have a higher fat content due to the higher tick burden of infected rodents, while this was not caused by the borreliae infection of the tick. Once a sub-adult tick has encountered a rodent, it needs to find a feeding site, bite the host and acquire a blood meal. It is generally assumed that each larva takes only one bloodmeal before moulting to a nymph. Factors affecting larval and nymphal blood feeding are comparable and therefore combined in this paragraph. Blood feeding of ]. Tick saliva has anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive effects on the host&#x2019;s immune system, facilitating blood consumption of ticks []. There are indications that aborreliae-infection results in an increased blood meal size of larvae. Infected engorged larvae collected from wood mice were heavier and moulted into larger nymphs compared to uninfected larvae []. A larva that acquired a complete blood meal detaches from the host to digest its blood meal and moult into a nymph. When the larva acquired borreliae during this blood meal, it will emerge as an infected nymph after moulting. Moulting success from larva to nymph can be influenced by host species and was higher for larvae that naturally attached to field collected ]. Endosymbionts are widespread among arthropods [. During moulting, borreliae spirochaetes survive in the midgut lumen of the tick and persistence until the next feeding is crucial for successful transmission [ larva to nymph is unknown. To maintain the enzootic borreliae lifecycle]. Not all host species used by ], which is probably explained by a lower rodent infection rate caused by a lower exposure to borreliae-infected nymphs during winter compared to spring, summer and autumn. Host infectivity is also influenced by host species and is lower in mice compared to voles []. These authors suggested that this was caused by a difference in time between inoculation and putative threshold for infectiousness. The aggregation of ticks among hosts results in an increased borreliae transmission when larval and nymphal tick burdens are correlated. In addition, infectivity increased with successive larval infestations and larval tick burden [], most likely due to a higher exposure of rodents to infected nymphs. Rodent infection rate varies between ]. Rodents acquire a borreliae infection through the bite of an infected tick and not via vertical transmission from female to offspring, as was shown for the Nearctic reservoir host ]. Not all host species are susceptible to each ]. When borreliae-infected  and frequencies of naturally occurring partially-fed larvae and nymphs are unknown. Ticks can be co-infected with more than one ]. Understanding the factors that affect the density of infected nymphs increases our knowledge on Lyme borreliosis risk. The development from questing ]. It was shown that ticks prefer odours from certain hosts over others. However, it is unknown if questing larvae can afford to reject a non-preferred host, risking the possibility of not acquiring any blood meal and starving to death. Rodents with high larval tick burdens, which are major contributors to the density of nymphs, have in general also higher nymphal tick burdens, making them more likely to be infected with borreliae. As a result, these rodents are even larger contributors to the density of infected nymphs. We hypothesize that this aggregation increases nymphal infection prevalence and that this aggregation is therefore necessary for the maintenance of the enzootic borreliae lifecycle. There is some evidence that the aggregation of ticks can be caused by borreliae []. Therefore, understanding rodent or tick manipulation by borreliae requires more experiments with experimentally infected rodents and ticks to exclude biases from differences in rodent characteristics on physiological or behavioural differences between infected and uninfected rodents and ticks. The borreliae lifecycle does not only benefit from aggregation of larvae on (borreliae-infected) rodents, but also from the successful development from larvae to nymph and the chance that aborreliae-infected nymph encounters a (borreliae-uninfected) rodent. Whether borreliae can affect interstadial tick development (e.g. moulting success) is unknown and requires more research to overcome a bias in the effect of the 90&#xA0;% mortality during development from larva to nymph []. Tick survival, rodent density, rodent infection rate and host infectivity are major factors affecting the borreliae lifecycle, whereas only the first two directly affect the tick lifecycle. These factors also interact with each other, e.g. even though infection rate and infectivity of bank voles was higher, the higher tick burden on wood mice and moulting success of ticks fed on wood mice made wood mice more important contributors to the density of infected nymphs []. The tick lifecycle clearly benefits from a high density of nymphs, whereas the borreliae lifecycle benefits from a high nymphal infection prevalence. However, the borreliae lifecycle also benefits from a high density of nymphs, when this will lead to a higher density of larvae and therefore a higher chance of borreliae transmission from rodent to tick and vice versa. There is evidence that borreliae can affect tick survival, increasing the density of nymphs and therefore enhancing its own lifecycle. Therefore, in addition, the tick lifecycle also benefits from a high nymphal infection prevalence. More knowledge on these multi-trophic interactions helps to obtain better estimates of the Lyme borreliosis risk. This review showed the various factors that contribute to the density of infected nymphs, and how they interact. These results, together with the effect of abiotic factors, could be mathematically modelled to determine the key processes that determine the density of infected nymphs, and thereby Lyme borreliosis risk.

Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (I) is a significant and often fatal disease of cultured Atlantic salmon in Norway. The consistent presence of Piscine orthoreovirus () in I diseased fish along with the correlation of viral load and antigen with development of lesions has supported the supposition that  is the etiologic agent of this condition; yet the absence of an  culture system to demonstrate disease causation and the widespread prevalence of this virus in the absence of disease continues to obfuscate the etiological role of  with regard to  In this study, we explore the infectivity and disease causing potential of  from western North America&#x2014;a region now considered endemic for  but without manifestation of I&#x2014;in challenge experiments modeled upon previous reports associating  with  We identified that western North American  is highly infective by intraperitoneal injection in Atlantic salmon as well as through cohabitation of both Atlantic and Sockeye salmon.

All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. In 1999, a new and emerging disease syndrome was described by the observation of a unique set of pathological changes in the heart and skeletal muscles of farmed Atlantic salmon ]. Through controlled laboratory studies, I has been shown to be infectious. The disease was transmitted to na&#x;ve fish by experimental injections with tissue homogenate from I-affected fish and through cohabitation with fish exhibiting I []. Following the discovery of  in fish with I, studies have further suggested a causal relationship between  and I by correlating higher viral load and  antigen in the heart of fish with I []. The occurrence of  in a wide range of hosts and geographic locations is particularly noteworthy to consider in the context of evaluating the pathogenicity of . For instance, in Norway, the presence of high loads of  in Atlantic salmon has been suggested as a requirement for the development of I because the occurrence of disease has not been reported without the presence of virus. However in western North America, where the presence of high  loads is also commonly abundant among wild and farmed salmon, there is no known occurrence of I, suggesting that  from western North America is avirulent or that factors other than the presence of  are required to cause disease. The context in which a disease occurs is dependent upon the complex interactions of the host, pathogen and their environment. In the case where  is not associated with I, as observed in western North America, a unique opportunity is presented to compare and contrast this virus to those circumstances in which  has been associated with  To this end, we exposed Atlantic and Sockeye salmon ]. Exposure studies utilized an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection route as well as a waterborne challenge through cohabitation with naturally infected Atlantic salmon to systematically evaluate the transmission dynamics and whether challenge with  from western North America could result in the development of I or other disease conditions. The tissue distribution of  in North American salmonids without I has not been well documented and thus an initial objective of this study was to evaluate  abundance in tissues of naturally infected Atlantic salmon within western North America. In naturally infected Atlantic salmon from a hatchery in British Columbia, Canada, blood, spleen and anterior kidney had the highest relative  loads out of 11 tissues tested, corresponding to 6.6 (Ct 11.6), 3.8 (Ct 13.8) and 0.4 &#xD7; 10).

To determine the infectious potential of this , + Atlantic and Sockeye salmon sentinels following the initial 41 week cohabitation experiment were separately re-cohabitated with newly introduced na&#x;ve Sockeye salmon sentinels. Further, a portion of + Atlantic salmon sentinels from the initial cohabitation experiment were held an additional 18 weeks (59 weeks post  exposure) before na&#x;ve Atlantic and Sockeye salmon were introduced for cohabitation. In both instances,  specific L1 transcripts persisted in infected individuals; however, viral transcripts could not be detected in newly introduced sentinels ().

In all cases, sequences of  obtained from I disease fish (gray) are distinguished from non-I associated variants (black). In this study, western North American  was shown to be highly infectious in Atlantic and Sockeye salmon.  was easily transmitted to these species whereby persistent infections were established with up to 100% prevalence. Virus infection was followed by periods of significant viral amplification and shedding which demonstrated the capacity of North American  to complete its life cycle in either Atlantic or Pacific salmonids. However, a complete lack of associated lesions and mortality in infected populations exhibiting high viral loads also indicates that western North American  is non-pathogenic. These finding are further supported by previous reports purporting the avirulent nature of  in western North America where high viral loads in the absence of disease was observed []. With fundamental infectious processes of western North American  resembling those of  found associated with I, it is curious as to what factor(s) could account for such pathogenic differences. Is the lack of disease observed in our studies herein simply a reflection of not employing an adequate infectious dose? Were the host populations employed in our study adequately susceptible? Is the absence of I herein a result of viral strain differences between  in western North America verses those associated with I in Norway or is the absence of I herein evidence that  is not the sole causative agent? For other aquatic viral pathogens, such as infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (V), infectious outcomes are often highly dose dependent. For instance, lethal disease in Atlantic salmon caused by V requires waterborne virus concentrations in excess of 10 plaque forming units per ml [] demonstrated that a inoculum generated from tissues of I diseased Atlantic salmon with a mean  Ct of 25.6 was sufficient to induce signs of I within 10 wpc. In our injection challenge of Atlantic salmon, a + inoculum at a Ct of 19.6 was used. Presuming equivalent detection efficiencies based on similar quantitative assessment methods, this represents a 64-fold higher  dose than one shown to induce I in Norway. Although  based quantitation methods do not give indication of infectious virions, comparable inoculum preparation techniques and similar temporal increases in viral  loads following challenge in these two studies suggests that the lack of I development in our challenge was not likely due to an insufficient exposure dose of infectious . Epidemiology of I outbreaks in Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon has identified that fish are commonly affected 5 to 9 months after transfer to sea, evidence that host life stage or saltwater exposure time might be important factors for disease []. Future work exposing Norwegian origin Atlantic salmon to western N American  will be required to fully understand the impact of host genetics on development of I Another important consideration must be given to isolate-specific genetic differences which could impact virulence. In some instances, viral associated disease can be attributable to a single genetic component which can be strain specific, as exemplified by the 0 variant of infectious salmon anemia virus (V) where a single deletion in the highly polymorphic region () of the virus genome changes the virus from a highly virulent disease agent to a ubiquitous non-pathogenic variant []. As noted from our exposure studies herein, the capacity of western North American  to infect erythrocytes and reach high viral loads as observed with Norwegian  suggests that the avirulent nature of western North American  is not a consequence of the strain&#x2019;s inability to infect and replicate in its host. Nevertheless, further research aimed at directly comparing western North American  with  that has been associated with I is required to fully assess if there are molecular indicators of virulence associated with this virus. A new and somewhat unexpected finding in the current study was the apparent loss of peer-to-peer transmission that developed during persistent  infections. Neither Atlantic nor Sockeye salmon that were infected with  by cohabitation for a period of greater than 37 weeks could transmit infection to na&#x;ve Sockeye or Atlantic salmon during six weeks of further cohabitation. This loss in infectivity may be a consequence of reduced viral load. During primary infectious cohabitation shedding fish had a mean viral blood load of 7.15 &#xD7; 10] and infiltrating blood-associated cells are likely responsible for increases in Mx transcription relative to cardiac myocytes during myocarditis based on viral tropisms, it is curious as to why  would cause such an elevated antiviral transcriptional response in heart tissues. Based on the culmination of current data, it could alternatively be speculated that the Mx antiviral response initiated during the inflammatory processes of I may be mostly independent of . Instead, the transcriptional and pathological responses during I could be caused by a discrete agent (such as a co-infecting virus) that produces a conducive state for continued opportunistic replication of  that may or may not contribute to disease. In conclusion, we demonstrate through both injection and cohabitation exposure that western North American  is capable of infecting and replicating to high quantities in blood and kidney of Atlantic and Sockeye salmon without causing disease. Infection dynamics and the genetic makeup of  from this study were highly similar to previous reports of Norwegian  in association with I, and other factors beyond the presence of  might be required to initiate a disease state in salmonid hosts. These findings also support a growing body of evidence suggesting that at least in western North America,  may simply be a ubiquitous virus found in opportunistic scenarios in diseased fish [], host condition, or specific environmental circumstances will need careful future consideration in understanding the role of  in diseases such as  All work with animals was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Canadian Council on Animal Care (C) Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. The protocols were approved by the Pacific Region Animal Care Committee (Animal Use Protocol Number: 13&#x2013;013 and 15&#x2013;003). All fish handling was performed under Aquacalm (Syndel Laboratories Ltd) or tricaine methanesulfonate (222) anesthesia. + and - populations of Atlantic salmon were sourced from separate commercial freshwater salmon hatcheries on Vancouver Island, British Columbia and brought to the Pacific Biologic Station () in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. The hatchery supplying &#x2013;Atlantic salmon had no known historical detection of  and pre-transport screening of 20 fish via -q proved negative for . Fish were maintained in  treated partial seawater (10&#xB0; &#xB1; 1&#xB0;C, salinity 7 ppt) for 5 months prior to their transition to undiluted  treated seawater (10&#xB0; &#xB1; 1&#xB0;C, 32 ppt). The + Atlantic salmon were obtained as smolts and pre-transport screening via -q of 47 fish demonstrated 100% positive for . Upon arrival at , fish were placed immediately into seawater (10&#xB0; &#xB1; 1&#xB0;C, 32 ppt) upon arrival at . Both + and &#x2013;populations were held under a natural photoperiod and fed dry pellets (S) at 1% body weight per day prior to challenge. &#x2013;fish used in the i.p. injection challenge provided the tissue source for the negative inoculum control during that challenge, and were used as sentinels for evaluating transmission of  through cohabitation. + fish provided the tissue source for the + inoculum in the injection challenge, were used as  donor fish during the cohabitation challenge, and were used for preliminary  tissue tropism investigations. Sockeye salmon fry (Sakinaw Lake stock; &#x2013;) were obtained from Rosewall Creek Hatchery, Fanny Bay, British Columbia and transferred to . Fish were reared in 6&#xB0;C (&#xB1; 1&#xB0;C) dechlorinated freshwater under a natural photoperiod for one year prior to transitioning to seawater, where they were held for 12&#x2013;26 weeks prior to challenge. These Sockeye salmon were utilized as sentinels during the cohabitation and persistent  infection potential challenges described below. Fish were initially fed daily at 2.8% body weight and subsequently transitioned to 1% at time of smolting. Additional stocks of &#x2013;(sentinel) Atlantic salmon and Sockeye salmon were obtained near the completion of the cohabitation study for use as newly smolted sentinels in the final persistent  infectious potential cohabitation experiment. The Atlantic salmon, transported from a commercial hatchery, were held at  in  treated partial seawater (10&#xB0;C, 6 ppt) for 13 days and subsequently at a salinity of 14.3 ppt for one month prior to their transition to undiluted  treated seawater (32 ppt) at the start the first persistent infection challenge. The &#x2013;Sockeye salmon (Pitt River stock) were obtained from Inch Creek Hatchery and reared at  in 6&#xB0;C (&#xB1; 1&#xB0;C) dechlorinated freshwater under a natural photoperiod for ten months prior to introduction to undiluted seawater. Real-time -q was performed using previously designed forward and reverse primers and TaqMan probe targeting the L1 fragment of the  genome ([]. A segment of the S1 region of  was targeted for genomic sequencing from seven naturally infected Atlantic salmon utilized in this study using methods previously described []. The resulting 1017 bp product was purified using Exo-  clean-up kit (Affymetrix, , ) and submitted to T Corp. for sequencing (T Corp.,Toronto, Ontario). Amino acid sequence was deduced from resulting nucleotide composition using Geneious R6 molecular analysis software and both nucleotide and amino acid similarities were compared to previously published  sequences using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool () on Genbank using Geneious alignment software. Samples of gill, skeletal muscle, eye, heart, blood, spleen, liver, kidney, pyloric caeca, brain and intestine were individually collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen from seven Atlantic salmon assumed to be infected with . Tissues were stored at -80&#xB0;C for one week and subsequently homogenized in zol extraction buffer (Life Technologies) using 5 mm steel beads and TissueLyser  (Qiagen) for 2 min at 25 Hz.  was extracted from the resulting homogenate as described by the zol manufacturer.  detection and quantification was conducted using -q as described above. Anterior kidney and heart tissues from 21 highly infected Atlantic salmon were selected based on having the lowest Ct scoring (highest viral load) out of a pre-screen of 40 fish. The selected + tissues were pooled and diluted 1:5 (w:v) in Leibovitz L-15 cell culture media supplemented with 50 &#x3;g mL copies/250 &#x3;L injection (Ct 19.6). Atlantic salmon (~ 75 g each) were anesthetized in an aqueous solution of Tricaine methanesulfonate (0.05 g/L) and given a 250 &#x3;l intraperitoneal injection of either + inoculum, &#x2013;inoculum, or L-15 (120 fish per treatment). Fish were placed in triplicate tanks and held in 11&#xB0;C (&#xB1; 1&#xB0;C) freshwater for 16 days where after the freshwater supply was replaced with sand filtered -treated 11&#xB0;C seawater (32ppt) for the remainder of the 24 week study. Clinical signs of disease, mortality, water temperature and salinity were recorded daily. Blood and tissue samples were collected from five fish per tank (fifteen fish per treatment group) following 3 days and 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 wpc. Blood samples (~0.5mL) were collected using a 22 ga needle and 3mL syringe and assessed for  by q diagnostic screening at all sampled time points as described above. Hematocrit was measured at 24 wpc. For all sampled time points, brain, gill, anterior kidney, heart, liver, and spleen were aseptically collected into se-free tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2013;80&#xB0;C prior to  extraction. For histopathology, a sample of eye, brain, gill, spleen, heart, liver, anterior kidney, pyloric caeca, intestine, and muscle/skin were collected at 6, 12 and 24 wpc. These tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol until further processing. Paraffin blocks were prepared and sections of 3 &#x3;m were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin for light microscopy as previously described []. A portion (15&#x3;g) of  extracted from 36 samples of head kidney and blood (representing six replicates for each i.p. challenged inoculum group at 1 and 2 wpc) that was not reverse transcribed for the detection of  was purified using 2 U of ase I (Life technologies) at 37&#xB0;C for 45 min followed by easy MinElute Cleanup (Qiagen) as per manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.  quality was visualized on a 1% bleach denaturing gel and 1.5 &#x3;g of each sample was reverse transcribed using a High Capacity c Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies) without ase inhibitor where the Random Primer mix was substituted with 50&#x3;M Olido d(T)] and the corrected normalized relative quantity was compared at each time point by a two-way  and Tukey post hoc test using Graphpad Prism 5.0 following Log transformation of the data. + Atlantic salmon donors (N = 171), with adipose fins removed for identification, were divided into three 2000 L cylindrical tanks containing 11&#xB0;C sand filtered and -treated seawater. In one tank, 115 &#x2013;Atlantic salmon sentinels were added. Each of the other two tanks received 60 Atlantic salmon and 67 Sockeye salmon &#x2013;sentinels. Each tank was monitored daily and tissue and blood samples were collected from 5 fish per treatment group in each tank at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 26, 39 and 41 wpc as for the i.p. injection challenged described above. Hematocrit was measured at 24, 38 and 41 wpc. Sockeye salmon sentinels were sampled at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 41 wpc for histopathology, while donor and sentinel groups of Atlantic salmon were sampled for histopathology at 12 and 41 wpc. Immediately following the 41 week cohabitation experiment described above, groups of 5 Atlantic and Sockeye salmon sentinels from the previous cohabitation experiment which had become infected with  were transferred in duplicate to tanks containing 10 - age matched na&#x;ve Sockeye salmon sentinals (2). At 6 weeks post cohabitation, all fish were euthanized and samples of blood and head kidney were extracted, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 until analyzed for viral load. Susceptibility of age-matched sentinel was confirmed by intraperitoneal injection of 15 sentinel Atlantic salmon and 14 sentinel Sockeye salmon with 100&#x3;l of diluted whole blood supernatant (1:4 w:v in L-15 media) from naturally infected + Atlantic salmon sampled at 4 to 6 weeks following the commencement of the first cohabitation challenge. For analyses of  infection, a subset (n = 5) of each of the injected salmon species were euthanized and sampled for blood and head kidney at day 13 post challenge with the remainder of the fish sampled at day 42 post challenge.

Reference lists were crosschecked. &#xA0;Randomised controlled trials in adults aged 18 or more with ischaemic stroke comparing endovascular treatment, including thrombectomy, with medical care alone, including intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-). Trial endpoints were functional outcome (modified Rankin scale scores of &#x2264;2) and mortality at 90 days after onset of symptoms. No language or time restrictions applied. &#xA0;10 randomised controlled trials (n=2925) were included. In pooled analysis endovascular treatment, including thrombectomy, was associated with a higher proportion of patients experiencing good (modified Rankin scale scores &#x2264;2) and excellent (scores &#x2264;1) outcomes 90 days after stroke, without differences in mortality or rates for symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, compared with patients randomised to medical care alone, including intravenous rt- Heterogeneity was high among studies. The more recent studies (seven randomised controlled trials, published or presented in 2015) proved better suited to evaluate the effect of adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy on its index disease owing to more accurate patient selection, intravenous rt- being administered at a higher rate and earlier, and the use of more efficient thrombectomy devices. In most of these studies, more than 86% of the patients were treated with stent retrievers, and rates of recanalisation were higher (&gt;58%) than previously reported. Subgroup analysis of these seven studies yielded a risk ratio of 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.75) for good functional outcomes and 0.86 (0.69 to 1.06) for mortality, without heterogeneity among the results of the studies. All trials were open label. Risk of bias was moderate across studies. The full results of two trials are yet to be published. &#xA0;Moderate to high quality evidence suggests that compared with medical care alone in a selected group of patients endovascular thrombectomy as add-on to intravenous thrombolysis performed within six to eight hours after large vessel ischaemic stroke in the anterior circulation provides beneficial functional outcomes, without increased detrimental effects. &#xA0; 42015019340. Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, Along with preventive measures, effective treatments are therefore needed to reduce the deleterious consequences of stroke. The study protocol was reported following -P guidelines guidelines. We included randomised controlled trials reporting on the efficacy and safety of adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, independently of the device used, compared with medical care alone, including intravenous rt- for ischaemic stroke in adults (&#x2265;18 years). To be included, studies had to mention functional outcome and mortality at 90 days after symptom onset as trial endpoints. We did not exclude studies a priori owing to poor quality, language, or time restrictions, but we excluded observational, non-controlled, or non-randomised interventional studies. Since our primary aim was to evaluate adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy compared with intravenous rt-, we excluded randomised controlled trials in which patients were not submitted to mechanical thrombectomy in the experimental arm (for example, trials only evaluating patients submitted to other types of endovascular treatment, such as intra-arterial rt- and urokinase-type plasminogen activator) or in which patients were not submitted to intravenous rt- in the control arm. Electronic identification of reports was conducted in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Sci, and . Grey literature was searched through appropriate databases (OpenGrey, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, British Library Thesis Service). We also consulted clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials Register, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform,  Registry, Stroke Trials Registry). The last electronic search was on 14 December 2015. We also cross checked the references of potentially eligible randomised controlled trials. For the search strategy we combined the terms (cerebrovascular disorder  stroke) with (mechanical thrombolysis  embolectomy  thrombectomy). The Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy was used to retrieve randomised controlled trials (see supplementary file S1 for details of the search strategy). Two reviewers (, ) independently screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved reports for potential eligibility. They then screened the full text of potentially relevant trials. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or with the help of a third reviewer (). Interobserver bias (the percentage of agreement achieved) was calculated. Two reviewers (, ) independently extracted data from the included randomised controlled trials using a standardised electronic form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or with the help of a third reviewer (). Another reviewer () double checked the extracted data. When possible we used data from intention to treat populations. When such data were not available, we used data from modified intention to treat populations, defined as participants who were included and completed the study (that is, some initially randomised who were excluded from analysis) regardless of compliance with the allocated interventions. We extracted per protocol data only when data from intention to treat or modified intention to treat populations were unavailable. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a good functional outcome at 90 days after the onset of symptoms, defined as a modified Rankin scale When symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage was not defined using S-T criteria, we accepted other definitions. Two reviewers (, ) independently assessed the risk of bias of individual studies using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Three additional criteria were sought: independent funding, early stopping of trial, and clinical trial registration to determine whether the trial was retrospectively or prospectively registered. If a trial was retrospectively registered, we considered the risk of bias to be high because of the risk of reporting bias. We used random effects meta-analyses (RevMan 5.3.3 software) weighted by the inverse variance method to estimate pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. When using the Mantel-Haenszel method we considered sample size and event rates. We chose risk ratios as effect measures owing to the greater similarity of relative estimates between studies with different designs, populations, and lengths of follow-up. When statistically significant differences in risk were found (P&lt;0.05), we also determined absolute effects and derived the additional number of participants with events per 1000 who benefitted or experienced harm from receiving the studied intervention. Because of inequalities in trial design, including patient populations and interventions, &lt;85% rate of stent retriever use), time to treatment, the administering of intravenous rt-, and characteristics of stroke. We carried out a sensitivity analysis by excluding data from unpublished trials. We evaluated the quality of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation () working group methods. &#xA0;Study flow selection All studies were multicentre, parallel, prospective randomised open blinded endpoint clinical trials (table 1). All but four (,  , , and ) were international. The number of participants ranged from 70 to 656. Overall, the studies involved 2925 participants&#x2014;1564 in the endovascular treatment arm and 1361 in the standard medical care (intravenous thrombolysis) arm, based on either an intention to treat population or a modified intention to treat population.

The main inclusion criteria were adults after stroke with time from symptom onset to intravenous thrombolysis of 3 to 4.5 hours and time from symptom onset to endovascular treatment between 5 and 12 hours. In contrast with  , , -, -, Y, and  trials, which only included patients who were also treated with intravenous rt-, some trials ( ,  , , and ) included patients who were not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis.

Intravenous rt- was administered in the control arms (standard medical treatment) of all studies.

The thrombectomy devices selected among the studies varied, and some studies used more than one device (see supplementary table S2). In the 2013 studies and Y early generation devices were mostly used (such as Merci retriever, Penumbra system, other aspiration systems, wire disruption), and only a small number of patients was treated with stent retrievers. Whereas in   and Y no stent retrievers were used, in   and  the rate of stent retriever use was low&#x2014;2.9% and 41%, respectively. However, among most 2015 studies the rate of stent retriever use (such as Solitaire , Solitaire 2, Trevo, Catch) was more than 86%. The time from acute stroke to endovascular treatment ranged from 225 to 355 minutes. In the intervention arm, recanalisation rates varied between 25.0% and 88.0% according to a score of &#x2265;2b/3 (perfusion of half or greater of the vascular distribution of the occluded artery) on the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction perfusion scale or modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction perfusion scale (see supplementary table S3).  did not report reperfusion rates.

Random sequence generation, blinding of outcome assessment, and selective reporting were considered as low risk items across studies. For Y and , the bias associated with random sequence generation is not known owing to lack of information.

The other five trials were stopped because of efficacy, after the publication of positive results in  : interim analyses were brought forward in  (63.2% of the planned sample size), - (70.0% of the planned sample size), and   (23.5% of the planned sample size), and enrolment was stopped because efficacy boundaries were met. In  and Y, indication of lack of equipoise led to enrolment being stopped before the efficacy boundary was reached&#x2014;in  after enrolling 25.4% of the planned sample size and in Y after enrolling 15.6% of the planned sample size. One trial ( ) was retrospectively registered in 2006, two years after the study start. Concerning attrition bias,   and   showed imbalances between withdrawals in the intervention and control arms. In   and , the lower number of participants between arms limited considerations about the effect of withdrawals on study results. Owing to lack of information for , attrition bias was not evaluable. All studies, with the exception of  (lacked details for modified Rankin scale score &#x2264;1 and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage), reported the sought outcomes (table 1, and supplementary figures S1 and S2 and S5 to S7). &#xA0;Forest plot for a good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale core &#x2264;2) at 90 days, including subgroup analysis by year of study publication. T=adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy &#xA0;Forest plot for mortality at 90 days, including subgroup analysis by year of study publication. T=adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy Overall, 1129 out of 2907 patients (38.8%) achieved a good functional outcome at 90 days. Patients receiving endovascular treatment had a higher chance of achieving a good outcome (risk ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.64; fig 3=0, P=0.99). Further sensitivity analysis excluding trials with low rates of patients treated with intravenous rt- in the control arm ( ) or with low rates of adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy in the endovascular treatment arm (  and ) also yielded similar results for all efficacy outcomes; all these trials were published in 2013. At 90 days, 482 out of 2880 participants (16.7%) died, without differences between arms in all cause mortality (risk ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.06; I=0%, P=0.43). Overall, 129 out of 2526 patients (5.1%) experienced symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, with no significant differences between treatment groups (risk ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.44; I= 0%, P=0.48). The number of included studies limited the evaluation of publication bias using funnel plots. Egger&#x2019;s (P=0.435) and Peters&#x2019; (P=0.483) tests were not suggestive of publication bias or small studies&#x2019; effects. For the trial sequential analysis, the proportion of patients with a favourable outcome (modified Rankin scale score &#x2264;2) was 33%, and an increase in risk ratio of 37% was assumed based on the risk ratio of 1.37 estimated for the independency outcome. The cumulative evidence overcame the minimum information size required (1873 patients), adjusted for the obtained increase in risk ratio and heterogeneity (see supplementary figure S3). The cumulative evidence was not adequately powered for evaluation of mortality, reaching 20.1% of the required information size for a 9% risk ratio reduction of mortality (see supplementary figure S4). Predetermined subgroup analysis for the primary efficacy outcome based on sex (see supplementary figure S5) and administered intravenous rt- across all patients (rt- versus no rt-; supplementary figure S6) was not significant between subgroups (P=0.61 and P=0.05, respectively). Subgroup analysis according to stent retriever use reached significance (P=0.04; supplementary figure S7), favouring high (&#x2265;85%) stent retriever use (risk ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 2.01) over low to no use (1.18, 0.88 to 1.58). Subgroup analysis according to risk of bias, characteristics of stroke, and time to treatment were not done because of the similar risk of bias across studies and because of lack of robust data for strokes involving the posterior circulation and time to endovascular treatment. In this systematic review we found that there is moderate to high quality evidence suggesting that the addition of endovascular treatment, in particular thrombectomy with stent retriever, to best medical care including intravenous rt-, improves the probability of a patient being functionally independent at 90 days after ischaemic stroke, without increased mortality or symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. These conclusions are based on 10 randomised controlled trials enrolling 2925 patients with ischaemic stroke. Although pooled analysis of these trials yielded statistically significant and clinically relevant effects, statistically significant heterogeneity was found among the results of the studies. This heterogeneity was driven by differences in methodological and clinical features between studies. There were disparities in inclusion criteria and in the interventions considered in both the standard medical treatment and the endovascular treatment arms; in particular, the proportion of patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis and adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, as well as the type of devices used for thrombectomy. These differences led us to look at the results of the 10 included randomised controlled trials separately, using two distinct subgroups: trials published in 2013, including  , , and  , and trials published in 2015, including  , , -, -, , Y, and . All the studies focused on strokes involving the anterior circulation, but  , , and  also included strokes in the posterior circulation as part of their inclusion criteria.  also included strokes involving the proximal artery (internal carotid or M1). The former were the only types of strokes included in  and - ,  , , -, and Y also included strokes of the M2 portion of the middle cerebral artery. Imaging evidence of large vessel occlusion (the index problem amenable by thrombectomy) was not required for enrolment in   and  but was an obligatory criterion in   and in all 2015 studies. In four studies it was also needed to document potentially salvageable brain tissue: perfusion imaging showing evidence of penumbra was required in three of the 2015 studies (, -, and  ), and  only included patients with a high S score&#x2014;that is, with imaging features suggestive of less extensive brain damage. Although   evaluated the existence of penumbra, this was not a criterion for enrolment. Most patients in the medical care arm (&gt;77%) were treated with intravenous rt- (the only exception being  ) as well as in the endovascular treatment arm (&gt;68% of the patients), except in  and   (where the rate of administered intravenous thrombolysis was low). In   the dose of intravenous rt- was reduced because of the study design and safety issues. Although all studies evaluated patients subjected to thrombectomy in the endovascular arm, the rate of patients who underwent adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy varied between studies. In 2015 trials this rate was high (&gt;77%). However, less than 40% of the patients were treated with thrombectomy in   and  but were given intra-arterial rt-, a strategy that has proved to be of little benefit because of an increase in complications. Considering the pathophysiology of ischaemic stroke and the knowledge acquired from   it can be concluded that faster, more efficient recanalisation is of paramount importance to reduce the infarction of penumbral brain tissue and thus contribute to improved clinical outcomes. As such, the prompt administering of intravenous rt- as well as timely intravascular intervention achieved in 2015 studies may have contributed to less brain tissue damage. Because of the reasons discussed previously and the rate and dosage of intravenous rt- used in both study arms, the trials published or presented in 2015 are more suited to test the true effect of endovascular thrombectomy on its index disease. We therefore consider that pooled results from these studies evaluate more accurately the benefit of endovascular treatment in general and adjunctive thrombectomy after intravenous rt- in particular, for ischaemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion. Based on these results, we conclude that patients undergoing adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy are twice as likely to be without disability and 1.5 times as likely to be functionally independent 90 days after an ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of anterior large vessels. Despite using data from multicentre randomised controlled trials, the information was not powered enough to evaluate the safety of endovascular treatment, including adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy. Furthermore, observational studies may be more adequate than randomised controlled trials to evaluate safety, as these may include patients who are usually excluded from randomised controlled trials, and follow-up is often longer. Lastly, the magnitude of effects may have been exaggerated by stricter patient selection and by a higher level of study site selection and interventionist proficiency compared with the real world. The prospective randomised open blinded endpoint design of all studies has greater similarities with everyday clinical practice and is more cost effective than double blinded randomised controlled trial designs. and to patient drop-out after randomisation. In stroke trials it is customary to provide outcomes at 90 days. so longer follow-ups could have contributed to a better understanding of the evolution of functional endpoints through time. Another limitation was the overall moderate risk of bias&#x2014;all the trials used the prospective randomised open blinded endpoint design, some were mostly funded by industry, six were stopped early, and one was registered retrospectively. Nevertheless, previous reports noted that industry sponsored studies can accurately report outcomes Finally, data from the  and Y trials have not yet been officially published. These data was extracted from scientific conferences and press releases. Therefore it is possible that the available information is not definitive. Recommending endovascular treatment, particularly adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers, as standard of care in ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of large vessels in the anterior circulation requires a restructuring of comprehensive stroke centres and of interventional neuroradiologists&#x2019; training to enhance the available resources. The baseline characteristics of the included population mean that the pooled clinical benefit attributable to adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy may only be applicable to patients younger than 85 years with strokes involving the large vessels of the anterior circulation where brain damage is not widespread and if the intervention is performed within six to eight hours after an acute stroke. Adding thrombectomy to standard intravenous rt- opens the conventional treatment window from 4.5 hours to at least six hours in these scenarios. Still, the decision to use adjunctive thrombectomy should be taken shortly after patients start to receive intravenous rt- Future studies should evaluate the optimal timeframe for adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy; its benefit in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, strokes involving the posterior circulation, and older populations; and its safety profile. Also, longer follow-ups could help provide a better understanding of the cost effectiveness and impact on budgets of implementing adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy. Finally, cost effectiveness analyses should be pursued to ascertain the value of endovascular thrombectomy before the widespread implementation and restructuring of comprehensive stroke centres. Intravenous thrombolysis is the standard treatment for acute ischaemic stroke, but the rates for recanalisation are not ideal The use of concomitant endovascular reperfusion techniques, such as adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, may help to improve clinical outcomes further This systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomised controlled trials provide moderate to high quality evidence suggesting that, in carefully selected patients endovascular treatment, particularly adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, provided within six to eight hours after ischaemic stroke involving large vessels in the anterior circulation, leads to improved functional outcomes at 90 days without increased mortality or symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage This evidence supports the need to restructure current neurointerventional resources and to change clinical practice Web extra supplied by authors  additional information Click here for additional data file.

Genetic stability of MeV is exceptionally high, both in the lab and in the field, and few regions of the genome allow for rapid genetic change. The regions of the genome that are more tolerant of mutations (, suggesting a common mechanism that biologically restricts the rate of mutation. Measles virus (MeV) is an enveloped virus with a nonsegmented, negative-sense  genome that is 15,894 nucleotides in length. It belongs to the genus ]. Wildtype MeV isolates are genetically heterogeneous, with 24 genotypes recognized to date (A, B1&#x2013;B3, C1&#x2013;C2, D1&#x2013;D11, E, F, G1&#x2013;G3 and H1&#x2013;H2) []. An association has not yet been established between specific genotypes and differences in severity of disease, such as progression to measles inclusion body encephalitis (E) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (E), which are rare, fatal neurological conditions that result from persistent measles infection in the brain []) and the lack of an appropriate animal model, a causal genotype-phenotype relationship might be impossible to establish even if the heterogeneity in the severity and clinical outcome of MeV infection might be influenced by the genotype of the virus at some level. Despite its genotypic diversity, measles has only one serotype, which implies a high degree of similarity in the surface antigens across all MeV strains. ]. The geographic variations in incidence are likely the result of varying degrees of vaccination coverage, and not the degree of protection that vaccination confers against various endemic genotypes. In contrast with neutralization studies performed using serum from vaccinated individuals, vaccine-derived monoclonal antibodies have indeed revealed differences in their ability to neutralize different genotypes. A number of monoclonal antibody studies have sought to provide a structural and biochemical basis for the antigenic differences between genotypes, and perhaps more importantly, to elucidate the antigenic similarities that allow for a single measles serotype in spite of genotypic variation [] and the long-lived immunity conferred by vaccination or natural infection suggests that MeV does not undergo any significant antigenic drift. In fact, there are surprisingly few regions across the entire MeV genome that allow for rapid change. These regions are discussed in the latter sections of this review. The genetic stability of measles is exceptionally high, and it has been observed that it undergoes remarkably little sequence variation over long periods of time, both in laboratory settings and in the field. In several studies on MeV genetic stability, comparison of genomic sequences obtained after passaging ]. Despite the multiple mutations that accumulate in strains of MeV that are associated with more severe neurological outcomes, these strains are no more genetically unstable than acute or vaccine strains of the virus. In fact, while high stability is seen in all strains of MeV, persistent viruses from E and E patients are perhaps even more genetically stable. Substitutions in E associated viruses can be extensive, but taking into consideration the substantial latent period of ~7&#x2013;10 years, the rate of molecular evolution for E strains is estimated to be 3.4 &#xD7; 10, but rather might be influenced by qualitative differences in the type of mutations that arise or variation in as yet unidentified host factors. The mechanistic underpinnings of viral persistence are currently an area of active investigation. Interestingly, high genetic stability has been observed for many other paramyxoviruses in addition to MeV, and reported substitution rates are similar across the  suggests a common mechanism that biologically constrains the rate of mutation. MeV and other paramyxoviruses exhibit much higher genetic stability than most  viruses and there are numerous factors that could be contributing to this difference. For many  viruses, extensive studies have been done to determine mutation rates due to intrinsic factors, rather than selection. For  viruses, the intrinsically error-prone polymerase and lack of proofreading mechanisms result in a much higher rate of nucleotide misincorporation than that observed for  viruses, and ]. However, the various selection pressures that drive this phenomenon in MeV are not well understood. The reasons for such shallow genetic diversity in MeV and other ]. If phase is an important feature for viral transcription, it might function as a constraint on synonymous mutations that disrupt the conserved phasing pattern. Recombination, which is an important mechanism for rapid genetic change in many viruses, might also be inhibited in part by the rule of six. Although recombination is common among positive-stranded  viruses that encode their own  polymerase [] exert an effect on translational efficiency, and could provide a significant constraint on the occurrence of synonymous mutations.  editing by adenosine deamination, resulting in biased hypermutation, may play a role in the generation of the sequence variation in the MeV genome. Members of an enzyme family known as adenosine deaminases that act on  (Rs) catalyze conversion of adenosine to inosine in the negative-strand  genome, which then pairs preferentially with cytosine residues during template copying [. Interestingly, it has been reported that the degree of hypermutation may vary between acute and persistent virus strains, particularly in the reading frame of the M protein []. No sequences from relapsing henipavirus encephalitis cases have been deposited in the database, but analysis of such sequences would help determine if the biased hypermutation seen in E is a general property of persistent paramyxovirus infection in the brain or unique to the biology of Me While the factors that constrain mutations and genetic variation in MeV are not well defined, the uneven distribution of mutational tolerance across the genome may provide some insight into the selective forces that drive its overall genomic stability. High tolerance for mutations in some regions of the genome is evidenced by the genetic variability observed in field isolates or passaged laboratory strains and a corresponding high tolerance for substitutional or insertional mutagenesis. A,B). Taken together along with biochemical evidence, these findings highlight several regions of the genome that are inherently plastic and indicate structurally flexible domains of the encoded proteins. These regions are discussed below:  The C-terminal domain of the N protein, known as , is one of the regions found to be most tolerant of insertional mutagenesis []. High sequence variability is also frequently observed in the P gene []. The sequence diversity observed in sequences of the M gene from wildtype viruses is relatively low [). Altogether, it appears that there is some fitness advantage to conservation of the MeV-M gene sequence, but the protein itself has a certain degree of structural plasticity and can change rapidly in response to different selection pressures. Variation might be expected in the viral fusion (F) and attachment (H) envelope glycoproteins due to immune selective pressures; however, both MeV envelope proteins are extremely stable. F is more conserved than the M or H genes, and the proportion of coding changes is lower. There are few differences between the F proteins of different wildtype or vaccine strains. Identical amino acid sequences of the F protein have been found between the attenuated Zagreb strain, the wildtype Edmonston strain, and the more recent wildtype -B isolate, despite a great disparity in the year they were isolated and a widely divergent passage history []. The level of variation observed in the H protein is extremely low [] might be the dominant constraint on the genetic stability of MeV-H (and paramyxovirus attachment proteins in general) regardless of whether the receptor is protein or glycan based. Future comparisons as to how tolerant -bearing paramyxoviruses are to insertional mutations in their  protein will be highly informative. The L open reading frame () stands out as the most conserved gene and it is highly refractory to insertional mutations [] may reflect the fitness costs associated with such insertions. In summary, the extremely low tolerance for mutation in any of the functional domains of the L protein likely reflects some degree of structural inflexibility and underscores the interdependence of the various structural domains in mediating the critical role of L in viral transcription and replication. Non-coding  comprises nearly 11% of the 16-kb MeV genome and exhibits some degree of conservation across wildtype and vaccine strains []. In the intergenic sequences, the 3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032; untranslated regions (s) that flank each transcription unit contain highly conserved gene-end () and gene-start () signals that mediate transcription termination and reinitiation during m synthesis []. Interestingly, despite the critical role of the s in viral replication and pathogenesis, they are surprisingly tolerant of insertional mutations. Insertional mutagenesis found the non-coding regions to be the most highly mutable regions in the genome, particularly the N/P, P/M, and M/F intergenic regions []. This observation suggests that mutation of the non-coding regions could be mechanistically involved in the development of persistence, but this remains to be determined experimentally. Genetic variation and antigenic drift are significantly constrained in MeV, and there are undoubtedly many variables that contribute to its limited evolutionary rate. This high genetic stability appears to be a shared property of the  (2015) study reflect the relative fitness costs compared with insertions in other nucleotide positions, as mutants were allowed to replicate in competition with each other during cell culture passages. Thus, a given genomic position might tolerate an insertion when examined in isolation, but may not be enriched relative to more fit mutants in this kind of whole-genome interrogation study. Future investigations are needed in order to address the more complex questions surrounding qualitative differences in mutations that arise under distinct growth conditions and how these differences relate to attenuation, virulence, or the development of viral persistence.

Sampling of Atlantic salmon and coho salmon was done during potential disease outbreaks, targeting lethargic/moribund fish. Fish were necropsied and tissues were taken for histopathologic analysis and testing for  by -q assay for segment L1 and conventional - for  segment S1. The  products were sequenced and their relationship to  strains in GenBank was determined using phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide and amino acid homology comparisons. The Atlantic salmon manifested the classical presentation of I with high  virus loads (low Ct values) as described in Norway. The coho salmon with low Ct values had myocarditis but only in the spongy layer, the myositis of red muscle in general was mild, and the hepatic necrosis was severe.

The main salmon species farmed in Chile include Atlantic salmon ]. In 2010 a new virus called piscine orthoreovirus () was described []. Piscine orthoreovirus is associated with heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (I), a disease of marine-farmed Atlantic salmon first reported in Norway and Scotland. I affects fish 4 to 8&#xA0;months after transfer to sea during the fattening stage, and is accompanied by low to moderate mortality (~20&#xA0;%) but morbidity rates have been reported as high as 100&#xA0;% []. There is a clear need for histopathological analysis of appropriate (i.e., &#x201C;fit for purpose&#x201D;) tissue samples for confirmatory diagnosis of I especially since  can be present asymptomatically in a wide range of fish species [].

No controlled laboratory studies have been done to link the -related virus to the pathological findings. In this study, we describe for the first time, the clinical presentation of  infections in two of the three major farmed salmonid species in Chile. We provide the first description of I in Atlantic salmon outside Europe and the first detection of I-like disease in coho salmon. The histopathological findings in the coho salmon are novel and appear to be associated with the presence of . We also undertook further genetic characterization of  isolates in this study and including  S1 sequences available in GenBank [] in order to improve on the information about the genetic diversity of . In the Atlantic salmon the affected fish had reduced feed intake, were lethargic, and some swum close to the net pen and in the direction of the water current. An additional movie file shows this in more detail (see Additional file ). Some of the moribund fish lost equilibrium and either recovered the equilibrium or died. In the coho salmon the affected fish had reduced feed intake, which was followed by appearance of dead fish floating in the surface water mainly in the corner of the net pen. 63 Atlantic salmon were analyzed from two farm sites, which were selected from 17 Atlantic salmon farm sites studied, and 85 coho salmon were analyzed from two farm sites, which were selected from nine coho salmon farm sites studied. The farm sites were chosen in order to increase the probability of detecting I disease in Atlantic salmon or I-like disease in coho salmon with the goal to establish a causal relationship between  and  Thus targeted sampling was carried out by an experienced Veterinarian at peak mortality during a suspected outbreak of I or I-like clinical disease in the absence of any pathogen other than , and the samples for histopathological examination were taken from selected fish showing I or I-like gross pathology.

Thus, the present study reports coho salmon cases with gross pathology lesions not described previously and a marked inflammation of the spongious layer in the heart and inflammation of the red muscle in the affected fish; both findings not previously described. In order to better describe the disease observed in coho salmon, and further link it to , one would have to reproduce the disease experimentally.

Cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis is a potentially fatal disease caused by infection mainly with the adult stages of the nematode ]. The Gram-negative bacterium ]. Prevalence of D is dependent on favourable climate and habitat for the microbiologic pathogens, their arthropod vectors and their mammalian reservoirs []. Epidemiological tools are essential to guide the definitive etiological diagnosis of D and establish adequate methods for prevention []. However, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first description in Mexico at the countrywide level. This study aimed to add useful information about the national serological distribution and epidemiological associations of four important vector-borne pathogens among dogs from different Mexican states. Seventy-four veterinary centres located in 28 cities represented 21 out of 32 Federate Mexican states in this study. Cities were selected in locations where D agents are more likely to be found. In order to geographically assess canine seroprevalence, states were grouped into eight different geoeconomic regions: northwestern (Baja California Norte, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Sonora), northeastern (Coahuila and Nuevo Leon), western (Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit), eastern (Puebla, Veracruz and Hidalgo), northcentral (Aguascalientes, Guanajuato and Quer&#xE9;taro), southcentral (Morelos), southeastern (Quintana Roo and Yucat&#xE1;n) and southwestern (Chiapas and Guerrero) (Fig.&#xA0; Each veterinary centre received at least 30 in-clinic tests. Veterinarians were asked to test dogs with clinical signs suspect for anaplasmosis, borreliosis, dirofilariosis and/or ehrlichiosis, and a similar number of apparently healthy dogs, under physical examination, from April 2011 to January 2012. Inclusion criteria for testing sick dogs was considered for the presence of one or more of the following clinical alterations: lethargy, hyperthermia, weakness, weight loss, oedema, polyuria-polydipsia, lymph node enlargement, joint inflammation, lameness, cough, dyspnoea, nasal discharge, pale mucous membranes, haemorrhagic disorders, ocular lesions or neurologic signs. The absence of consistent history and/or evidence of abnormalities compatible with D were considered exclusion criteria and these dogs were included in the healthy group. The study was carried out in accordance with the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, issued by the Council for the International Organizations of Medical Sciences. Dogs were entered in the study under owner consent. Veterinarians recorded additional data of the dogs using a questionnaire that included health status, gender, age (&lt; 1&#xA0;year or&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1&#xA0;year), size [small (&lt; 10&#xA0;kg), medium (10&#x2013;25&#xA0;kg) or large (&gt; 25&#xA0;kg)], lifestyle (outdoors or indoors), detectable tick infestation, use of treatment (mainly tetracycline, doxycycline, imidocarb and/or ivermectin) against tick and mosquito-transmitted infections as those evaluated here, and travel history to other regions or abroad. Whole blood, serum or plasma samples from dogs were tested by means of a rapid in-clinic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay () kit (P&#x; 4Dx&#x; from &#x; Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, ), according to the instructions listed in the product package insert. This assay screens for simultaneous qualitative detection of a circulating carbohydrate of ]. Statistical analysis was performed using S 20.0 software. Values for prevalence were established. Chi-square and Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests were used to compare proportions of positivity related to categorical dependent variables. A probability -value&#xA0;&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis was subsequently performed. Significant differences between categories were quantified calculating odds ratios () and their 95&#xA0;% confidence intervals (). Practitioners tested a total of 1706 dogs over the study period. Information about health status was recorded for 1665 dogs: 943 apparently healthy and 722 D-suspect dogs; no data were available for 41 dogs.

Lowest seroprevalence was observed in the northcentral area of the country (2.4&#xA0;%).

The regions described in the study presented here resulted from a geoeconomic division of the country. This classification is not coincidental with a climatic division, which according to humidity and temperature categorizes the country into areas with a warm wet, warm humid, dry, very dry, mild humid and mild wet climate (Fig.&#xA0; Seropositivity values for  reported here must be interpreted as current infection with or previous exposure to the pathogens under assessment. Positive dogs to ]. The very low ]. Although little is known about Lyme disease and its transmission cycle in this country, seroprevalence of antibodies to ]. Epidemiological data about dirofilariosis in Mexico is very variable and results from previous studies are difficult to compare due to differences in the efficacy of the diverse diagnostic techniques used, size and geographical origin of the population examined and study season []. The overall ]. Several epidemiological variables were considered in the present study, in order to evaluate potential associations with seropositivity to D agents. Prevalence encountered for each pathogen varied depending on the geographical region. Despite this finding, dogs with travel history to other regions or abroad did not show significant differences in seroprevalence. No link was detected between gender and positivity for D agents, which is in agreement with previous studies []. Seropositivity value for ]. As reported previously [], positivity among small-breed dogs in this study was significantly lower compared to dogs of medium and large size. Correlation between the presence of clinical signs and seropositivity was statistically significant for all of&#xA0;the D agents analysed. Co-infections were the main cause of illness detected in D-suspect dogs. According with previous publications, the most common combinations included ]. As described before [) infection and the place where dogs lived in this study. However, the low number of positive dogs for borreliosis detected in the study presented here precludes any conclusion. Effective preventive measures are not always affordable in Mexico, so off-label injectable bovine ivermectin formulation and/or tetracycline, doxycycline and imidocarb are routinely used to treat suspected infections with D agents []. One possible explanation for this finding is that most of the dogs treated for tick-transmitted infections in the study presented here had detectable infestation with ticks (76/85), one of the main risk factors for positivity to D agents. On the other hand, positivity for any D agent was not associated with the use of macrocyclic lactones against canine heartworm infection in the present survey. One of the limitations of this study is that a geoeconomic division of the country instead of a climatic division was used when it was designed. Discrepancies between both classifications could have influenced the results obtained for different regions depending on the location of the veterinary practices. Furthermore, it is worthy of note that despite the wide geographical distribution of the veterinary centers that participated in this study, a potential bias derived from selection of the cities could have influenced the results obtained here. This study adds valuable epidemiological information about the current situation of  across Mexico. The findings highlight that dogs in Mexico are at risk of acquiring any of the zoonotic D, which were under assessment. Veterinarians must be alert about this situation as they have a key role in the identification and control of these diseases in dogs and humans. Nowadays, updated information and products are widely available, which allows provision of better and more effective diagnostic and preventive programmes for dogs. ; , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; , mosquito-transmitted infections; nd, no data; , odds ratio; , tick-transmitted infections Dataset supporting the conclusions of this article.

Anthrax is a zoonotic disease that occurs naturally in wild and domestic animals but has been used by both state-sponsored programs and terrorists as a biological weapon. A Soviet industrial production facility in Sverdlovsk, R, proved deficient in 1979 when a plume of spores was accidentally released and resulted in one of the largest known human anthrax outbreaks. In order to understand this outbreak and others, we generated a  phylogenetic reference. The 1979 Russian anthrax outbreak resulted from an industrial accident at the Soviet anthrax spore production facility in the city of Sverdlovsk. Deep genomic sequencing of two autopsy specimens generated a draft genome and phylogenetic placement of the Soviet Sverdlovsk anthrax strain. While it is known that Soviet scientists had genetically manipulated  strain collection. This genomic identity can now be used for forensic tracking of this weapons material on a global scale and for future anthrax investigations. Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by ). The ). The offensive anthrax weapons development programs were stopped in the United States and United Kingdom in the 1960s but continued covertly in the Soviet Union for at least another 20&#xA0;years ( genome to change its phenotypic properties can and has been accomplished, raising concerns about dual use. Evidence of the Soviet anthrax program&#x2019;s continuation and its scale were revealed by the 1979 industrial accident in Sverdlovsk, R (now known as Ekaterinburg), where at least 66 people died of inhalational anthrax ( confirmed that this cluster of deaths was indeed due to anthrax. Here we have continued the Sverdlovsk anthrax investigation through deep sequencing of the formalin-fixed tissues from two of the victims to generate a draft genomic sequence of the infecting  strain involved in a historic anthrax incident. We have constructed a high-resolution reference phylogeny from a large global &#xA0;in the supplemental material to facilitate efforts by other researchers to place their strains in these established clades. Phylogenetic structure of ). The overall consistency index is 0.98. The deeper phylogenetic relationships (). The unusually short lengths of the deepest branches of the  clade, coupled with the high frequency of isolates and geographic expansion, are indicative of a rapid and extensive evolutionary radiation (). Many sublineages of this clade diverged before mutations occurred, leading to a lack of synapomorphic characters (shared alleles that could group some of these sublineages together) and the existence of a large polytomy (a node with 7 immediate descendant lineages: Tsiankovskii, , Pasteur, Heroin,  011, and two lineages with 1 and 2 genomes each). The expansion of each of these lineages also leads to multiple distinct groups, also often with very little topological resolution in the deeper nodes. Given the number of isolates assigned to the  011 group, the  clade can be divided into two main subgroups: paraphyletic  008/011 (r.008/011) and monophyletic  (r.011). By direct  sequencing, we generated metagenomic data from paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed pathology specimens from two anthrax victims from the 1979 outbreak in Sverdlovsk,  The presence of . Alignment status for Sverdlovsk  genomes From the reads, we assembled the Sverdlovsk genome into 128 contigs with an ) on this assembly identified 5,579 s; the same analysis on the Ames ancestor genome identified 5,756 s. This demonstrates that while most of the genome was successfully assembled, parts of the genome may have been dropped from the assembly, most likely from insufficient coverage or collapsed repeats. Formalin fixation is known to damage nucleic acids, and this was demonstrated by the small size of the extracted  fragments ( in the supplemental material). All 329  sites were present in the composite genome assembly. Excluding 29  sites on the p1 and p2 plasmids because they have higher copy numbers, the coverage per  averaged 20&#xD7; at 273 of the remaining 300 genomic positions on the chromosome. Fourteen of the other chromosomal  sites contained less than 10 reads per site but still corresponded exactly to the expected base changes. Overall, we were able to discover and verify all of the known s using the Sverdlovsk pathology specimen sequencing data. Based upon these two error estimations, we are confident that the sequenced genomes are of sufficient quality to justify our conclusions. Based upon shared s, the Sverdlovsk genomes fall within the &#x201C;Tsiankovskii&#x201D; subclade of the  008/011 group ( in the supplemental material). These three genomes emerge from a polytomy, showing rapid divergence of these lineages before shared s could arise. As this clade is comprised of laboratory strains, this divergence may be due to anthropogenic establishment of different lineages from a laboratory stock. Other clade members were isolated from anthrax-killed animals and are mostly Eastern European in origin, with the exception of one from China and one from Norway. Therefore, with the exception of the three &#x201C;domesticated&#x201D; strains, the clade members are naturally occurring wild-type strains. The sequencing and analysis of Sverdlovsk genomes offer an opportunity to detect s and to look for possible strain mixtures or contaminating  profiles from two of the tissue samples. To do this, nucleotides from individual reads are tabulated, and less than 100% agreement represents potential errors or mixtures at that genomic position. In particular, we are interested in the 13 s that are unique to Sverdlovsk genomes as they allow a comparison to all other strains outside this group to identify mixtures. ). Read mixtures at Sverdlovsk genome-specific s Particular genes and  signatures in the Sverdlovsk genomes were examined for evidence of genetic manipulation of this strain. In the chromosome, fluoroquinolone resistance is known to be determined by amino acid changes in the ), though this was not a closed genome. Hence, there is no evidence from this analysis of either molecular-based genetic engineering or classical bacteriological selection for altered drug resistance phenotypes. Sverdlovsk contigs aligned to the Ames ancestor genome. The reads from both autopsy specimens were combined for  assembly, which resulted in 128 contigs. These are aligned against the Ames ancestor chromosome and two plasmids, and the synteny was visualized with mummerplot. Greater than 99% of the Ames ancestor genome is represented by these 128 contigs. The ). Fortuitously, the genome variation that we can identify through whole-genome sequencing generates insights into anthrax history and allows predictions about its ecology. The clade structure we observe with whole-genome sequencing is consistent with previous descriptions using lower-resolution methods or few genome sequences. What we add in this report is the precise definition of branching points, accurate branch length determinations, and the definition of canonical evolutionary characters for strain identification. Branch topology determination has been problematic with other molecular methods because of the abundance of short branches and polytomies at critical positions in the evolutionary structure. The A clade itself, but in particular its subclade , is evidence for evolutionary radiations representing genetic bottlenecks, long-distance dispersal, and bursts in the fitness of these lineages. Even in a radiation, binary fission of replicating bacterial cells should result in phylogenetic structure that could be identified with sufficiently discriminatory methods. But in some cases, such as with the  clade, even whole-genome analysis does not yield topological phylogenetic structure, arguing for a very tight genetic expansion. This subclade contains a large portion of the world&#x2019;s anthrax burden (), suggesting that specific ecological dynamics related to sporulation/infection rates must also be involved for anthrax. Ancient genomes from archeological sites would greatly assist in the temporal calibration of key branch points. Detailed genome databases are a great resource for public health and forensic investigations of disease outbreaks (), and this will not be possible prior to a disease outbreak. Inspired by other preserved pathology tissue  analyses ( locus could not be assembled from these specimens due to its repeat structure, and the other victim specimens had very limited  that was prohibitive for metagenomic analysis. Hence, our analysis does not eliminate the possibility that mixed strains were involved in the Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak. The Soviet &#x201C;battle strain&#x201D; 836 was isolated from nature (). All of this is highly suggestive of a weapons program that identified a suitable strain, maintained master cell stocks to avoid extensive passage, and performed minimal manipulations in order to maintain virulence. This strategy must have been used to produce large quantities of highly virulent material, as evidenced by the anthrax deaths in 1979.  was extracted from paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues from two victims as previously described () values were subjected to Illumina sequencing, first on a MiSeq and later on a HiSeq 2000. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the standard Kapa Biosystems Illumina  Library reagent kit (catalog no. 8232; Kapa Biosystems, Boston, ), using 12 cycles in the final amplification reaction. Due to the highly degraded nature of the input , fragment size selection prior to library preparation targeted fragments that were &lt;500&#xA0;bp. Both samples yielded libraries with enough material for sequencing and were pooled and then sequenced using an entire MiSeq 600 cycle paired-end run with V3 chemistry. This same pool was subsequently sequenced on a HiSeq 2000, using two lanes. Sequencing adapters were trimmed from reads with Trimmomatic (). To understand the error profiles in the Sverdlovsk genomes, reads were aligned against the Ames ancestor with -, and for each position, the number of alleles that conflicted with the dominant allele was divided by the total number of bases at the position; this value was considered the per-base error rate. As a control, this procedure was also performed for another genome (A0362) in the same phylogenetic group. Error rates were binned into different categories and represented as a histogram (see  in the supplemental material). To obtain a draft genome assembly, reads from both victims were combined and assembled with des v.3.6.0 () was used to examine the synteny against the Ames ancestor as the reference.

Laboratory mice were experimentally infected via tick bite with one of two strains of  using q. The proportion of infected nymphs was used to characterize the pattern of host-to-tick transmission over time. Both strains of  followed a similar pattern of host-to-tick transmission. Transmission decreased from the acute to the chronic phase of the infection by 16.1 and 29.3% for strains A3 and A10, respectively. Comparison between strains found no evidence of a trade-off in transmission between the acute and chronic phase of infection. Strain A10 had higher lifetime fitness and established a consistently higher spirochete load in nymphal ticks than strain A3. Quantifying the relationship between host-to-vector transmission and the age of infection in the host is critical for estimating the lifetime fitness of vector-borne pathogens.

Many vector-borne pathogens establish long-lived chronic infections in their vertebrate reservoir hosts []. Host-to-tick transmission success can vary dramatically over the course of the infection.

The acute phase contains both co-feeding transmission (2&#xA0;days ) and systemic transmission (34&#xA0;days ) whereas the chronic phase only has systemic transmission (66, 94, 128 days&#xA0;). Our 35-day cut-off between the acute and chronic phase is similar to the 30-day cut-off used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to distinguish between early and later signs and symptoms of  in humans. We experimentally infected female  gene of the challenge strain did not match the rOspC immunogen) and the 10 control mice developed a systemic infection following the nymphal challenge. The 18 uninfected mice were excluded from the present study because host-to-tick transmission for these individuals is obviously zero. Of the 23 mice that developed a systemic infection, 10 were infected with strain A3 and 13 were infected with strain A10. To measure co-feeding and systemic transmission, mice were infested with larval ]. The nymphs were frozen at&#xA0;-20&#xA0;&#xB0;C at 4&#xA0;weeks after moulting into the nymphal stage. For the first infestation and for all subsequent infestations, a maximum of 20 and 10 nymphs were frozen, respectively. A total of 1,174 nymphal ticks were processed during the experiment.

Nymphal ticks were considered infected if at least two of the three runs of the q assay tested positive for  infection status of each nymphal tick as a function of two fixed factors: the age of the infection (2, 34, 66, 94 and 128&#xA0;days), strain (A3 and A10), and their interaction. Mouse identity was included as a random factor. The spirochete load of each nymphal tick was calculated as the geometric mean of the three replicate runs (negative runs were excluded), as described in a previous study []. For the subset of infected nymphs (i.e. uninfected nymphs were excluded), a linear mixed effects () model with normal errors was used to model the log10-transformed spirochete load as a function of the age of the infection, strain, and their interaction.

The present study shows that these theoretical models should consider incorporating the decrease in transmission efficiency between the acute and the chronic phase of the infection. The two strains differed in their spirochete load in the nymphal ticks. We had previously shown that the mean spirochete load in nymphs infected as larvae via systemic transmission during the acute phase of the infection was two-fold higher for strain A10 than for strain A3 []. We recently characterized the community of  to test whether strains carrying o A10 are infectious to humans. If strain A10 has higher lifetime transmission success than strain A3, what allows strain A3 to persist in nature? One possible explanation is the hypothesis of multiple niche polymorphism (), which suggests that these strains are adapted to different vertebrate reservoir hosts []. Thus strain A3 may persist if it is a better competitor than strain A10 in mixed infections in either the vertebrate host or the tick. Future experiments should compare host-to-tick transmission success between mice infected with single strains and mice co-infected with multiple strains. The pattern of host-to-tick transmission of  and may explain why strain A10 is so common in nature. Data analysed in the present study.

Flea-borne diseases have a wide distribution in the world. Studies on the identity, abundance, distribution and seasonality of the potential vectors of pathogenic agents (e.g. ) are necessary tools for controlling and preventing such diseases outbreaks. The improvements of diagnostic tools are partly responsible for an easier detection of otherwise unnoticed agents in the ectoparasitic fauna and as such a good taxonomical knowledge of the potential vectors is crucial. The aims of this study were to make an exhaustive inventory of the literature on the fleas (Siphonaptera) and range of associated hosts in Iran, present their known distribution, and discuss their medical importance. The data were obtained by an extensive literature review related to medically significant fleas in Iran published before 31, the etiological agent of plague. We found records of at least seven vector-borne pathogenic agents that can potentially be transmitted by the 117 flea species (or subspecies) of Iran. Herein, we performed a thorough inventary of the flea species and their associated hosts, their medical importance and geographic distribution throughout Iran. This exercise allowed assessing the diversity of flea species with the potential flea-borne agents transmission risk in the country by arranging published data on flea-host associations.

All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. Vector-borne diseases (s) are globally responsible for more than 17% of all infectious diseases []. Fleas (Siphonaptera) are small, bloodsucking or hematophagous ectoparasites that may transmit pathogens through several possible mechanisms, including: contaminated feces (e.g. ]. Over 2500 flea species belonging to 16 families and 238 genera have been described worldwide []. Some fleas tend to be host specific (restricted or specialist), but others have a wide host range (permissive, opportunistic). The permissive species group are more significant than the restricted ones, because they can spread infectious agents among and within their multiple hosts and across a diverse series of habitats []. In order to prevent or control the occurrence and spread of flea-borne diseases, it is thus necessary to establish a taxonomical inventory of the flea fauna and their specific distribution range. Climate changes, due to global warming and human intervention, have led to changes in the biological parameters and distribution ranges of vectors and hence of s []. Iranian physicians were familiar with the human plague for a long time. Although there are little information about the situation of plague from earlier centuries, more documented evidence are available from the 19th and 20th centuries. As a matter of fact, faunistic studies of Iranian fleas have been carried out mainly about 60 years ago in a context of plague research and most species described at the time were collected and described off plague hosts []. This finding triggered some concern about the possible plague reemergence in the countryside, in the old plague foci and called for an update on the state-of-knowledge of the flea diversity in the country. The aims of the present study were to update by reviewing the current state of knowledge of the Iranian Siphonaptera diversity, their host range and especially the medically important species. This review was based on a search of the online scientific databases (Scientific Information Database) PubMed and Google Scholar from 1952 through 31] and studies of two flea specialists, the Iranian Farhang-Azad and the French . Klein. In each case the flea species, its host, and location of sampling were extracted from the published papers. The flea distribution maps were prepared using Arc (Arc version 9.3, I). An online software were used to further classify and quantify the shared and exclusive vertebrate hosts of fleas with the &#x201C;family or subfamily&#x201D; filtering criteria[]. The data for this study were extracted from about 100 relevant papers in English, French, Istanbul Turkish or Russian. Faunistic reviews of the medically significant fleas showed the presence of fleas through 31 Iranian provinces (). In the old classification of Iran provinces used by Farhang-Azad (1972b), the Khorasan province, which was the largest province of Iran in the plague research era, is currently divided in three provinces namely Razavi Khorasan, North Khorasan, and South Khorasan. This means that the spatial scale of the flea range resolution is less accurate in the old literature as it covers a larger area where the flea and their host are not homogenously found. Based on the information in the studied papers, the sampling locations mainly were human houses, animal husbandry premises, poultry farms, and rodents&#x2019; burrows. According to the literature, about 117 species or subspecies of fleas belonging to 7 families and 35 genera have been described in Iran. Most flea species reported in the studied literature belonged to the Ceratophyllidae (n = 33), Leptopsyllidae (n = 24), Pulicidae (n = 21), Ctenophthalmidae (n = 20) and Coptopsyllidae (n = 9) families. The flea species of the Ischnopsyllidae (bat-fleas) and Vermipsyllidae (carnivore-fleas) families consisted of only 6 and 4 species of the whole collection respectively (Tables ). ]. * Altough Leptopsyllidae further classified as subfamilies Amphipsyllinae and Leptopsyllinae and the tribes Amphipsyllini and Leptopsyllini []. The Ceratophyllidae, the more represented flea family, consisted of 33 species belonging to 6 genera, comprising . The Leptopsyllidae, bird and rodent fleas, consisted of 24 species consisting of 10 genera including . The Ctenophthalmidae consisted of 20 species belonging to 7 genera comprising . The Pulicidae, a cosmopolitan family of the most notorious plague vectors (genus . The Coptopsyllidae was limited to 9 species in the genus . In the above-mentioned five families, the most commonly reported fleas belong to the genera . The hosts associated with Iran fleas ranged from the small mammals (Rodentia, Chiroptera, Lagomorpha, Insectivora) to the large mammals (Ungulata, Carnivora, Primates, Artiodactyla) and birds as well. On the whole, 166 vertebrate host species were reported infested by fleas in Iran in the literature including Pulicidae (n = 56), Ceratophyllidae (n = 38), Ctenophthalmidae (n = 29), Leptopsyllidae (n = 22), Coptopsyllidae (n = 11), Ischnopsyllidae (n = 7) and Vermipsyllidae (n = 3). By filtering the compiled data, we recognized 77 vertebrate host species among all seven flea families. Eight potential mammals were hosted by &#x2264;7 flea (sub-) family respectively; these were: .  Vermipsyllidae At least 23, 6, 5, 5 and 1 host species are exclusively infested by Pulicidae, Ischnopsyllidae, Ceratophyllidae, Ctenophthalmidae and Leptopsyllidae respectively. However restricted host species was not found in the Coptopsyllidae and Vermipsyllidae (). A total of 53 vertebrate species were reported infested by six subfamilies of Ctenophthalmidae including Ctenophthalminae (n = 20), Stenoponiinae (n = 12), Rhadinopsyllinae (n = 9), Anomiopsyllinae (n = 6), Doratopsyllinae (n = 3) and Neopsyllinae (n = 3). By filtering the compiled data, 29 vertebrate host species were distinguished among all six subfamilies. Correspondingly 8, 6 and 1 host species are exclusively included in the Ctenophthalminae, Stenoponiinae and Doratopsyllinae. However there were not found any restricted vertebrate host species in the Anomiopsyllinae, Neopsyllinae and Rhadinopsyllinae (). A total of 33 vertebrate species were reported infested by three subfamilies of Leptopsyllidae including Amphipsyllinae (n = 17), Mesopsyllinae (n = 9) and Leptopsyllinae (n = 7). By filtering the compiled data, 22 vertebrate host species were distinguished among three subfamilies. Investigation on the flea-host associations in subfamilies of the Leptopsyllidae showed that there were no common host species shared by the three subfamilies. However 6, 3 and 2 host species are exclusively included in the Amphipsyllinae, Leptopsyllinae and Mesopsyllinae respectively (). A total of 83 vertebrate species were reported infested by three subfamilies of Pulicidae including Xenopsyllinae (n = 43), Pulicinae (n = 20) and Archaeopsyllinae (n = 20). By filtering the compiled data, 56 vertebrate host species were distinguished among three subfamilies. Exploration of flea-host associations in Pulicidae pointed out that there are eight common hosts including ). The literature inventory of the fleas of Iran showed that there are seven Siphonaptera families in this country namely Ceratophyllidae, Leptopsyllidae, Pulicidae, Ctenophthalmidae, Coptopsyllidae, Ischnopsyllidae and Vermipsyllidae. These flea families are distributed in all parts of the country where sampling occurred and where data were available. According to the literature reviewed, the distribution range of those families extends in Hamadan and Kurdistan (West Iran) provinces rather than in Ardabil (northwest), Northern Khorasan (northeast), Bushehr (south), Mazandaran, Golestan and Gilan provinces (north). This fact is partly due to a collection bias in plague foci during the sixties (1963&#x2013;1975 Baltazard, Klein, Farhang-Azad and Mollaret)[]. The distribution maps of the studied fleas showed that further sampling, especially from provinces with poor faunistical studies, is necessary, especially in a context of vector-borne disease epidemiology where known mammalian hosts of pathogenic agents are also present. Most fleas of medical or veterinary importance belong to the Ceratophyllidae, Leptopsyllidae, Pulicidae, Ctenophthalmidae and Vermipsyllidae families [ was infested by 11 flea subfamilies and Xenopsyllinae were hosted by at least 43 mammal species.

Fleas are also considered vectors of ]. Most leptopsyllids parasitize rodents and a few birds. Species of ]; however its presence and identity in the region is very questionable. People who travel to rural areas should consciously avoid flea bites especially in populations camping outside (herders, travelers, nomads) and avoid exposure to wild rodents and their fleas. In domestic areas, in order to prevent bites and thus disease transmission to humans, the floors and walls, as well as the rodents&#x2019; burrows around settlements, should theoretically be sprayed with insecticides. A few days later the application of rodenticides is necessary. There were virtually no records of some flea species in a few provinces like North Khorasan (). This is mainly due to inadequate inventories, especially in remote areas, or minorly due to the changing of geographical boundaries where the number of provinces in old classification has increased from 10 to 31 provinces. In this paper we highlighted the geographical gaps on the Siphonaptera fauna of Iran. Generally, it shows that extensive fundamental and systematic research is still needed to determine the impact of off-host abiotic conditions and host identity (either mammal or bird) on host specificity, and on the potential for flea-borne diseases spread and transmission risk. Co-evolution partly explains host-flea relationships which are translated into various degrees of host specificity (as shown in Tables ]. Den/nest making hosts (mammals or birds) display a more specific flea fauna than non roosting species []. Since rodent-borne, bat-borne and vector-borne diseases are the major rising concerns to health authorities, and threats to public health making inventories of the host and their ectopoarasitic fauna has become as never before a priority. Although most flea-borne diseases are not classified in the 17 neglected tropical diseases (s) list made by the World Health Organization, this doesn&#x2019;t mean those are unimportant or not causing an underestimated morbidity burden worldwide. The lack of recognition by major stakeholders, and the local lack of diagnostic tools and awareness are impeding improvements into flea-borne disease research. However, with about seven human or zoonotic highly pathogenic agents circulating among -possibly- the 117 flea species throughout Iran, there is an urgent need to organize and fund flea-host-pathogen ecological surveys in the face of rapid environmental and human behavioral changes. The first step in identifying the risk linked to flea exposure is to make a list of the species before any public health measures can be taken. Flea-borne diseases are caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious agents which distribution, prevalence and incidence are currently increasing. However, the data about fleas and their medical significance in different geographical regions of Iran is limited. We took the first step in this paper but supplementary studies are required to i) complete the list, especially in areas where there are no reportsor poor faunistic studies and ii) perform molecular screening of flea pools in order to detect specific pathogen circulation in domestic fauna and wildlife in order to prevent future epidemics.

Using dogs as sentinels for these pathogens can aid in recognition of the public and veterinary health threat that each pose. Vector-borne diseases are an emerging concern for veterinarians and physicians in much of Canada. The prevalence of vector-borne infections, including Lyme borreliosis (), is increasing, apparently due to changing environmental and climatic conditions [].

From 1 March to 30 June 2017, 203 measles cases were laboratory-confirmed (108 sporadic cases and 95 related to 47 clusters). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the co-circulation of two different genotypes, D8 and B3. Both genotypes caused nosocomial clusters in two hospitals. The rapid analysis of epidemiological and phylogenetic data allowed effective surveillance and tracking of transmission pathways. A large measles outbreak has been ongoing in Milan and surrounding areas, a densely populated area with nearly 4 million inhabitants. Rapid and active surveillance was set up by the Subnational Reference Laboratories () Milan, established as part of the measles and rubella surveillance network MoRoNet [] in March 2017, with 303 investigated cases at the time of submission of this report. We present a detailed analysis of the period 1 March to 30 June 2017, with the aim to conduct a complete and rapid characterisation of wild-type measles virus () strains circulating.  From 1 March to 30 June 2017, 233 suspected cases of measles were investigated: there were 203 (87%) laboratory-confirmed cases (median age: 30 years; range: 2 months&#x2013;77 years) and 30 (13%) were discarded. Overall 60% (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;121) of the confirmed cases were individuals aged 15&#x2013;39 years and 6% (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;12) were&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1 year of age; 88% (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;179) were not vaccinated and 12% (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;24) were vaccinated (six with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella () vaccine, 10 with one dose, and eight did not know the number of doses). According to the epidemiological regional database, 108 of 203 were sporadic cases and 95 were related to 47 clusters. Cases were classified as sporadic when an epidemiological link to other cases could not be established. The genotype of  strains was successfully identified in 187 of 203 (92%) of the confirmed cases by sequencing the highly variable region of nucleoprotein (N) gene (N-450) []. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the  strains belonged to genotypes D8 and B3. The most common genotype detected was genotype D8 (86%; 160/187 cases) which was related to 77 cases in 42 clusters and 83 sporadic cases. All of the D8 cases and clusters were autochthonous or from unknown source. In March 2017, the B3 genotype was detected in five imported cases: two sporadic cases and three cases which subsequently caused three import-related clusters. From April to end of June 2017, a further 14 autochthonous sporadic cases and one cluster were reported. The geographical and temporal distribution, respectively, of sporadic cases and clusters related to D8 and B3 genotypes are shown in . Geographical distribution of measles cases and clusters, with genotypes, Milan, 1 March&#x2013;30 June 2017 (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;187 cases) Temporal distribution of measles cases and genotypes detected, Milan, 1 March&#x2013;30 June 2017 (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;187) Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the D8 sequences (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;160) fell into the Osaka lineage (i/OsakaN/29.15; similarity range: 99&#x2013;100%). From March to May, D8  strains mainly caused clusters in work and family settings, which occurred principally in the north-eastern area of Milan. During the week starting on 27 March 2017, a serious family cluster affected three cases causing the death of one of them. The D8  strain was isolated from the biological samples of one of these cases. In June 2017, the D8 Osaka variant spread through the city of Milan and caused a nosocomial cluster in a hospital. Based on epidemiological data, a link was established between 12 cases: eight healthcare workers (s), three patients and one visitor. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the nine sequences obtained were 100% identical. The match of epidemiological data and phylogenetic analysis highlighted a single transmission chain for all cases (). Neighbour-joining tree for nucleotide sequences of measles virus D8 and B3 variants causing nosocomial clusters in two hospitals, Milan, 1 March&#x2013;30 June 2017 (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;16) Phylogenetic analysis showed that all B3 sequences (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;27) were identical to the variant Dublin (s/DublinL/8.16; similarity: 100%) which is circulating in European countries and responsible for an ongoing epidemic in Romania []. The B3 Dublin variant was first introduced in the east of Milan at the beginning of March 2017, and there was an epidemiological link to the Roma community in France. By the end of March, this variant was detected in a sporadic case returning from Piedmont (northern Italy). Subsequently, the same variant was isolated in a cluster caused by an index case returning from the Apulia Region (southern Italy) and in a cluster that was imported from Romania. In April 2017, genotype B3 was identified in a sporadic case returning from the Lazio Region (central Italy). During May and June 2017, 12 autochthonous cases were notified in the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Milan. In June, three nosocomial clusters were identified in an emergency department. Although initially reported as unrelated clusters, the phylogenetic analysis showed a single source of transmission (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;7, two s, four patients, and one visitor) (). Eliminating measles and rubella is a core goal of World Health Organization European Region Member States. Effective surveillance is essential for eliminating measles and rubella and its verification []. Timely measles surveillance is critical to disease control. Identifying and confirming suspected measles cases through surveillance allows early detection of outbreaks and analysis of ongoing transmission in order to mount more effective vaccination measures.  genotyping can play an important role in tracking transmission pathways during outbreak investigations []. From March to June 2017, the genotypes D8 and B3 co-circulated in Milan and surrounding areas. The most common genotype detected was genotype D8, related to 83 sporadic cases and 42 clusters. The high similarity between the D8  strains, all belonging to the Osaka lineage, suggests a unique initiating transmission event. This is the first evidence of the Osaka D8 variant in northern Italy, which seems to be replacing the D8 variants that had been circulating in this area since 2013 []. Moreover, our data show multiple imported cases of B3  strains which subsequently spread across Italy and caused several autochthonous cases and clusters. The B3 Dublin variant has replaced the B3 variant Como that had been present in this Italian area from August 2015 to November 2016 []. By the end of June 2017, D8  strains and B3  strains had caused clusters in two major Milanese hospitals. In August (current month), the epidemic is still ongoing and the number of notified cases during the month of July was almost twice the number of cases notified in June. Other authors have already reported that where there is evidence of both nosocomial and community transmission of measles, nosocomial transmission appeared to precede community transmission with a peak of hospital-acquired cases occurring almost two weeks before the peak of the community outbreak []. In conclusion, the suboptimal immunisation level (92.5% vaccination coverage rate in Lombardy Region; []) and the consequent accumulation of susceptible population have led to an increase in the transmission of measles in northern Italy with detrimental effects on both public health and ongoing measles elimination efforts. Furthermore, the nosocomial outbreaks highlight the importance of improving measles vaccination coverage of healthcare workers. The authors wish to thank the staff in regional and local health authorities involved in outbreak investigation and reporting of measles cases to the Italian national integrated measles and rubella surveillance system coordinated by the Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Unit of the National Health Institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanit&#xE0; &#x2013; ).

The age range was 0&#x2212;55 years and 66% of the cases were under 9 years. The Roma population was disproportionally affected (89% of cases), 41% cases were unvaccinated and in 24 cases there was nosocomial transmission mostly in paediatric departments. A child under 12 months of age died. Control measures have been taken and the investigation is still ongoing. Since 17 March and until 31 August 2017, a total of 204 suspected measles cases were reported to the web-based National Measles Surveillance System (S) in Bulgaria. In Bulgaria, measles has been a statutorily notifiable disease since 1921 [). Here we present preliminary findings and the control measures implemented at the beginning of the ongoing measles outbreak. For the outbreak investigation, the  measles case definition is being used []. Any person meeting the clinical criteria i.e. fever, maculopapular rash and at least one of cough/coryza/conjunctivitis, is classified as possible case; any person meeting the clinical criteria and with an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case is classified as a probable case; and any person not vaccinated in the previous 6 weeks and meeting the clinical and the laboratory criteria is defined as a confirmed case. Thirty-nine cases did not fulfil the case definition and were discarded on the basis of laboratory criteria and epidemiological data [], as follows: 122 confirmed, 36 probable and seven possible cases. All cases were epidemiologically investigated and laboratory tests were performed at the National Reference Laboratory for Measles, Mumps and Rubella (-) at the National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases () in Sofia. Sera collected in the region of Plovdiv after mid-May were tested for IgM/IgG at the Medical University of Plovdiv. The index case in the outbreak was a 2-year-old child from a large Roma community in Plovdiv. The child was admitted to the infectious diseases ward of the regional hospital with diarrhoea and other enterocolitis symptoms. After 3 days, the child developed typical measles symptoms and the national health authorities were informed on the same day. There was further transmission in the family or in the hospital setting. The epidemic curve of cases by week of symptom onset shows the dynamics of outbreak (). Measles cases by week of symptom onset, Bulgaria, March&#x2212;August 2017 (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;165) Males (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;93) were more affected than females (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;72; ratio: 1:0.8). The majority of cases (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;107; 65%) were children under 9 years of age. The median age of cases was 4 years (range: &lt;&#x2009;1&#x2212;55). A high number of cases were not immunised (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;67, 41%) and nearly half of them (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;35) were children under 1 year of age who are not eligible for vaccination. Among vaccinated cases, those having received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine (77; 47%) were prevailing. The distribution of measles cases by age groups and vaccination status is shown in . Complications were registered in nine cases: two presented with pneumonia and seven with diarrhoea. One of the confirmed measles cases, a child under 1 year of age, died. Cases were recorded in three of the 28 Bulgarian administrative regions (). As in the previous large measles outbreak in Bulgaria (2009&#x2013;2011), the Roma population living in Plovdiv and Pazardjik was the most affected group (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;147 cases, 89%). The cases described here represent the three clusters from the regions of Plovdiv, Pazardjik, and Montana. The epidemiological link between Plovdiv and Pazardjik clusters is under investigation. Measles cases by region, Bulgaria, March&#x2212;August 2017 (n&#x202F;=&#x202F;165) The index case was found here on 17 March 2017. This is the most affected region with 141 (85%) measles cases reported. Among these cases, 100 (71%) are confirmed, 35 (25%) are probable and six (4%) are possible cases. Almost all measles cases (127, 90%) were registered among the Roma community. The median age of cases is 5 years (range: &lt;&#x2009;1&#x2013;55). The first case was reported to the S on 13 May 2017, in a child aged 15 months, vaccinated at the end of March 2017 with the first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (1). A total of 20 cases were reported to the S from this region: 18 confirmed at the -, one probable and one possible. All measles cases in this region were occurred in Roma population with a median age of 2.5 years (range: &lt;&#x2009;1&#x2212;21). The first case was reported on 2 May 2017 in a non-vaccinated adult in their late 20s, who had visited Romania three weeks before symptom onset, where there is a large measles outbreak ongoing with 8,937 cases recorded between 1 January 2016 and 25 August 2017 []. The following case occurred in a family member. Another two sporadic cases were also registered in this region. A total of four cases were reported, all of them confirmed at the -. From 17 March to 31 August 2017, a total of 79 measles cases were tested at the - with a commercial indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (anti-Measles IgM/IgG antibodies, Euroimmun test kit, Luebeck, Germany). All samples collected from measles cases received at the  were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against both measles and rubella. The remaining samples were tested for anti-measles IgM/IgG antibodies in regional laboratories. Viral  extraction and amplification were performed for 41 urine and 56 nasopharyngeal specimens using  kit ( GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis were performed at the World Health Organization () European Regional Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany and at the  in Sofia. Sequential analysis of the samples of the initial cases in Plovdiv, Pazardjik and Montana showed measles genotype B3, which has been dominantly circulating in Europe (France, Italy and Romania) over the past 2 years (). Phylogenetic tree showing the measles genotype B3 in Bulgaria, March to August 2017 Following the risk assessment of the situation related to increasing measles incidence in many European countries and a permanent threat of importation [], the Bulgarian Ministry of Health (MoH) disseminated an official warning letter to all Regional Health Inspectorates () on 13 March 2017. A National Coordination Council for the management and response to the measles outbreak was established ad hoc at the MoH on 22 March 2017, after the detection of the outbreak. Letters with recommended control measures were provided immediately: general practitioners were requested to check the immunisation status of all persons aged between 13 months and 18 years and to immunise all those unvaccinated with one dose of  vaccine; medical specialists in hospitals and outpatient settings were requested to be alert to the early detection, timely reporting, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment of measles cases. It was also recommended to hospitalise patients with measles living in crowded households, in order to ensure better conditions for treatment and care and to minimise the spread of the disease in communities with poor living conditions. Therefore, most of the cases in the affected regions were admitted to the infectious diseases ward (159, 96%). The measles monovalent vaccine was introduced in Bulgaria in 1969. Consecutively, the combined  vaccine was implemented for the first dose given at 13 months of age (in 1993) and the second dose at 12 years (in 2001). The analysis of the past 5 years reveals that vaccination coverage with the two doses of  is sub-optimal (&lt;&#x2009;95%) (). A downward trend of the  vaccine coverage, mostly expressed for the second  dose, has been observed. During the past 3 years, the national average was below 90%. Sub-national analysis shows that one third of the regions have reported an 1 coverage below 90%. : measles-mumps-rubella. Following the occurrence of the index case in March 2017, three clusters of measles cases were registered in Bulgaria. Roma population living in two neighbouring regions in Plovdiv and Pazardjik was the most affected group. According to the latest national census in Bulgaria in 2011 []. Two main features of the ongoing outbreak can be outlined: (i) the existence of a vulnerable group of Roma population non-immunised or insufficiently immunised and (ii) nosocomial measles transmission in the paediatric departments of two hospitals in Plovdiv. The recommendation to hospitalise vulnerable Roma children, may also have contributed to the latter. The analysis of the immunisation status of the cases shows a prevalence of those having received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine (77; 47%) however, some of them might have been immunised during their incubation period and thus, these data need to be interpreted with caution. The last indigenous measles cases in the country before the outbreak in 2009&#x2013;2011 were registered in 2001. Since then, several importations were reported []. Along with the sub-optimal national vaccination coverage with two doses of  vaccine registered during the past 5 years, the current outbreak revealed that pockets of non-immunised and insufficiently immunised population, especially in Roma communities, continue to exist. The low vaccination coverage is a risk factor for importation and spread of measles in Bulgaria. Continued strengthening of surveillance and improving vaccination coverage in general population is need to avoid the spread of the outbreak to other regions of the country and to prevent exportation. The current outbreak also shows that special intensified vaccination activities should be directed to the Roma population. Measles outbreaks affecting vulnerable groups, including Roma communities, have been reported in other European countries [].

Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular thrombectomy are the main revascularization therapies for acute ischemic stroke. However, ischemia-reperfusion injury after revascularization therapy can result in worsening outcomes. Among all possible pathological mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion injury, free radical damage (mainly oxidative/nitrosative stress injury) has been found to play a key role in the process. Free radicals lead to protein dysfunction,  damage, and lipid peroxidation, resulting in cell death. Additionally, free radical damage has a strong connection with inducing hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema, which are the major complications of revascularization therapy, and mainly influencing neurological outcomes due to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. In order to get a better clinical prognosis, more and more studies focus on the pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical neuroprotective therapies against free radical damage. This review discusses the pathological mechanisms of free radicals in ischemia-reperfusion injury and adjunctive neuroprotective therapies combined with revascularization therapy against free radical damage. Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide []. Successful recanalization of the responsible cerebral vessels which lead to blood reflow is the primary target after the onset of acute ischemic stroke. However, there are also possible complications after revascularization, among which cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury is one of the most serious. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a common and inevitable problem after revascularization therapy. Although successful recanalization leads to the restoration of cerebral circulation, a fair amount of patients still do not improve in terms of symptoms and function []. Among these complex pathophysiological mechanisms, free radical damage to the brain plays a pivotal role in the process of ischemia-reperfusion injury during revascularization therapy. In order to get favorable clinical outcomes, there is a clear need to develop adjunctive neuroprotective therapies against ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this review, we focus on the role of two major free radicals ( and ) in ischemia-reperfusion injury as well as on adjunctive therapies, especially against oxidative/nitrosative stress, that combine revascularization therapy. The brain only makes up 2% of the whole body weight, but represents almost 20% of the body's oxygen consumption, generating more free radicals than other organs. Additionally, brain tissues contain considerable amounts of lipids with unsaturated fatty acids and high concentrations of iron, so the brain is more vulnerable to free radical damage []. Free radicals are divided into two main groups: reactive oxygen species () and reactive nitrogen species ().  and  play key roles in many pathological processes during ischemia reperfusion. Currently, free radicals' toxicity in ischemia-reperfusion injury is being intensively studied. Oxidative stress is caused by excess production of . The major detrimental types of  include superoxide anion (O]. While in the process of cerebral ischemia reperfusion, especially during the reperfusion phase, production of free radicals increases remarkably, leading to the breakdown of antioxidant systems. According to a previous study, excess generation of  comes from four pathways: the mitochondrial chain respiratory chain;  oxidases; reaction of arachidonic acid catalyzed by cyclooxygenase 2; and xanthine and hypoxanthine via xanthine oxidase []. In the following section, we will discuss some mechanisms regarding  toxicity to brain tissues during ischemia reperfusion. Oxidative stress can cause cell death via  damage, lipid peroxidation, and changes in protein structure and function (]. They can lead to the dysfunction of proteins by binding to thiol groups and depletion of  through reactions with -Px and glutathione S-transferase, inducing more serious oxidative stress injury.  can also regulate some major apoptosis and necrosis signaling pathways (]. As previously discussed, with the wave of neuroinflammation, immune cells containing  oxidase produce considerable amounts of , aggravating oxidation stress injury. In turn,  can also activate these inflammatory cells.  activate microglia, neutrophils, and macrophages via the nuclear factor kappa B (-]. Nitrosative stress is mainly caused by .  has two major species,  and O]. Excess  may lead to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (), cell death, and inflammation. The activation of matrix metalloproteinase pathways which is one type of crucial pathways in the opening of the  and the distribution of tight junction proteins which are the main components of the  are both influenced by  []. O], causing tight junction protein rearrangement and dysfunction, leading to an increase in  permeability and disruption of the  integrity during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Revascularization therapy may cause severe complications, such as hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema, and free radical damage during ischemia reperfusion has a strong connection with these complications (). Patients who experience these complications may get worse outcomes, even the responsible large vessel recanalization. Hemorrhagic transformation is strongly connected with the integrity of the . The  is a semipermeable barrier between peripheral circulation and the central nervous system, preventing some blood substances from reaching the brain. The  contains vascular endothelial cells, tight junctions, the basal membrane, and pericyte and astrocyte end feet []. Edema caused by free radicals can be divided into vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema. Vasogenic edema is related to the increased permeability of the , the mechanisms of which are discussed above. Cytotoxic edema is connected with the dysfunction of ion transport in membranes. The ion transport proteins oxidized by  include ion channels, ion pumps, ion exchangers, and ion cotransporters.  can peroxidize membrane phospholipids, oxidize sulfhydryl groups located on the ion transport proteins, inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, and decrease  levels, which will induce dysfunction of ion transport leading to cytotoxic edema []. Free radical damage in ischemia-reperfusion injury severely impacts prognosis after revascularization therapy. Thus, determining how to protect the brain from free radical damage is extremely urgent. In the following section, we review some of the most recent and effective therapies used to prevent free radical damage in ischemia-reperfusion injury that are used in combination with revascularization therapy. The adjunctive strategies have been both understudied in experimental and clinical research. The therapies are divided into two groups: nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical. Nonpharmaceutical therapies consist of remote ischemic conditioning and hypothermia, and pharmaceutical therapies consist of edaravone, uric acid, and citicoline. Remote ischemic conditioning () was first introduced in a canine cardiac study by Przyklenk et al. []. The mechanisms of protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury are under discussion, and some specific mechanisms remain unknown (]. Although most of the evidence of protection by  is from cardiac research, an increasing number of studies have indicated that  is effective in protecting the brain against ischemia-reperfusion injury. As mentioned previously, erC and ostC are more suitable for clinical events. Hoda et al. used a murine embolic clot model of stroke, which is better able to physiologically and clinically represent human stroke cases, and found that erC performed 2&#x2009;h after O combined with alteplase injected 4&#x2009;h after O was more effective than erC or alteplase alone []. Thus, we can see that although  is still new, it represents a promising treatment, and more clinical research regarding this technique is needed. Therapeutic hypothermia as a method of neuroprotection against acute ischemic stroke has recently seen extensive research. Therapeutic hypothermia in ischemic stroke involves methods to reduce temperature (especially brain temperature) to a specific range during or even after ischemia to protect neurons in the brain. Methods to induce hypothermia include whole body surface cooling or selective head cooling as well as whole body intravenous cooling or intra-arterial local cooling, which may or may not be combined with hypothermia-inducing drugs. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and there is no conclusion regarding which technique is best []. Although therapeutic hypothermia has been widely researched and detailed in cardiac aspects, the best methods and target temperature in acute ischemic stroke are still under discussion. The mechanism of hypothermia against ischemia-reperfusion injury has been recently studied (]. Some studies have found that cooling experiments can decrease the activity of t []. The primary difference between these studies described above is that the patients participating in Hong's and Ma's study all exhibited anterior circulation occlusion and had successful recanalization. Hypothermia protects the  by inhibiting the generation of free radicals when vast oxygen reflow along with blood during reperfusion after successful recanalization, further reducing cerebral edema and brain hemorrhage. Thus, hypothermia may be more effective in patients with blood reflow. The hypothermia group patients in the uS-L study were hospitalized in the intensive care units for at least 36 hours after treatment and may have received more attention, causing an ascertainment bias. Although most research has presented neutral results, the better outcomes that were found during reperfusion are still promising, especially after successful recanalization. Its safety and feasibility may allow hypothermia to be used more frequently or to even lengthen the thrombolysis therapeutic window. Additionally, almost all clinical researches regarding hypothermia combined with intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment have been mild (35&#xB0;C&#x2013;32&#xB0;C), so other ranges of target temperatures should be the focus of further research. In brief, the protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury during recanalization may allow therapeutic hypothermia to be more promising and useful. Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, has been widely used as an acute stroke treatment in Japan and China for a long period of time. Edaravone can eliminate free radicals during ischemia reperfusion and has inhibitory effects on lipid peroxidation in the arachidonate cascade. Edaravone can also inhibit inflammatory responses during ischemia reperfusion []. Edaravone functions by attenuating cerebral edema, reducing hemorrhagic transformation, and leading to neuroprotection. Because of its numerous advantages, many researchers have focused on edaravone connected with thrombolysis. Proteolytic activity is one of the deleterious effects of t, causing extravasation of t from the cerebral vessels, which leads to neuronal damage. In a thromboembolic stroke model, Kano et al. found that edaravone injection combined with t concomitantly could protect reperfused cerebral vessels and significantly attenuate extravasation, probably by prevention of peroxidation of vascular endothelial cells []. Although this conclusion is gratifying, T4.5 is an observational and nonrandomized study and the dose of t that was administered was 0.6&#x2009;mg/kg. Nevertheless, cotreatment of edaravone and t is fairly promising and has provided satisfying results in many studies. To apply these findings to clinical practice, a large-scale randomized clinical trial will need to be undertaken in the future. Uric acid () is the end oxidative product of purine nucleotides catalyzed by xanthine oxidoreductase, an endogenous free radical scavenger.  can scavenge free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and O]. Presently, many researchers have found that  has a neuroprotective function, including those treated with thrombolysis, due to its antioxidant properties. The high serum uric acid at admission or obtained within a median 24 hours after stroke onset was independently associated with better clinical outcome at 7 days or 90 days in t patients []. There is an interesting phenomenon that should be addressed:  exhibits different effects depending on gender. Llull et al. found that cotreatment of  and t could reduce infarct growth and produce better outcomes than the placebo group only in women, not in men []. These explanations may illustrate the gender difference, but a firm conclusion has not been drawn. More research should be conducted regarding these gender differences, and more clinical trials should be conducted. Citicoline is an essential exogenous form of cytidine-50-diphosphocholine that is involved in the formation of phosphatidylcholine and is also very important for maintenance of the membrane []. Andersen et al. reported that a lower dose citicoline combined with t reduced the size of brain infarcts more than using t alone []. However, there are many explanations for these neutral results such as the high stroke care standard, which can benefit recovery especially in nonthrombolysis patients, and the higher average  value in Davalos' study. Although a number of studies support citicoline combined with t as being beneficial for protecting the brain from ischemia-reperfusion injury, there are still some disappointing results, especially in clinical trials, and more research should be conducted in this area. Free radicals, especially  and , have intense oxidation or nitrification abilities in the human brain. During cerebral ischemia reperfusion, especially with blood reflow, massive generation of  and  leads to cell death via  damage, protein dysfunction, and lipid peroxidization. Oxidative/nitrosative stress in ischemia-reperfusion injury also plays a key role in inducing hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after revascularization therapy. Fortunately, many basic experiments and clinical trials have indicated that cotreatment of antifree radical damage strategies, including nonpharmaceutical therapies, such as  and hypothermia, and pharmaceutical therapies, such as edaravone, , and citicoline, with revascularization therapy is safe and feasible. Further research regarding therapies that prevent free radical damage in ischemia-reperfusion injury combined with revascularization therapy should be undertaken in the future. We will understand the pathomechanisms more deeply, and patients will get better benefits from revascularization therapy.

The third plague pandemic originated from Yunnan Province, China in the middle of the 19 plague focus. The c3 spacer present in the previously isolated strains was absent in the spacer arrays of the Ypc  loci of the strains isolated in 2016. The A analysis using A (14+12) showed that the strains isolated from the human plague case and host animal plague infection in 2016 in Yunnan displayed different molecular patterns than the strains that had previously been isolated from Yunnan and adjacent provinces. All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. Plague is an acute infectious disease caused by . Three major types of plague exist in humans: bubonic, pneumonic and septicemic plague. Person-to-person transmission typically occurs only among patients with pneumonic plague. Two subspecies of the pathogens that cause plague have been recognized based on their pathogenicity in the anthroponotic form: ]. Based on historical data, Yunnan Province was seriously affected by the plague prior to 1955 [ biovars are orientalis. In China, plague epidemics have been successfully controlled in house rat foci since the mid-1950s. Moreover, active animal plague surveillance programs have been conducted annually in China since the 1980s. However, after a 26-year silent period, a human plague epidemic reemerged in the western region in Yunnan and then spread eastward from 1986&#x2013;2005 [ biovar orientalis strains was reported in 2016 in Yunnan. In the present study, three molecular subtyping methods, including different region analysis (), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (), and multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (A), were used to describe the genetic relationships among the strains isolated in 2016, as well as isolates from the previous plague epidemics in the house rat plague focus. In addition, a source tracing investigation was performed using the A(14+12) scheme. All procedures involved in the survey and diagnosis of human plague cases were performed in accordance with ethical standards. This research was approved by the Ethical Committee [Institutional Review Board ()] of National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention (C), China  (License number: C-2014013). All animal sampling procedures conducted in this study involved only three dead rats; thus, animals were not sacrificed in the present study. The procedures were conducted in accordance with the animal care and use regulations of the Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention (C). On May 28, 2016, a suspected case of human plague in Jinghong County of the Xishuangbanna (subsequently referred to as Banna) Prefecture (] was used to identify one retrospective bubonic plague case in an epidemiological investigation. Two hundred twenty-one O and was used as a template for  amplification. The number on the dendrogram line indicates the A14 scheme subclade. The  analysis []. Bionumerics 6.6 software (Applied-Math, Belgium) was used to conduct the , , and A(14+12) molecular subtyping analyses. , , and A14 were used to illustrate the phylogenetic relationships among isolates collected in Yunnan and adjacent provinces. The A(14+12) scheme was used for genetic source tracking among the strains grouped into the same subclades with the human plague case-related strains isolated in 2016. The A profiles were analyzed as categorical data and the  (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages) was used as a clustering arithmetical algorithm. Corresponding dendrograms or minimum spanning trees (s) were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with the Dice genetic distance coefficient []. On May 28, 2016, a human plague case was identified in a 68-year-old woman who had no underlying diseases. The patient lived in Jinghong County of the Banna Prefecture ( obtained during routine animal plague surveillance were biovar orientalis. The ,  method and an A14 scheme were used to illustrate the phylogenetic relationships among biovar orientalis isolates from house rat plague foci and two sylvatic plague foci (biovar antiqua) in China. The  genomovars of the four orientalis isolates obtained in 2016 were genomovar 09 (]. The arrays of the  loci identified in the ]. The A14 scheme revealed 23 subtypes among the strains analyzed in the present study (). Thick solid lines connect types that differed in a single R locus, thin solid lines connect types that differed in 2 R loci, and other lines connect types that differed in more than 2 R loci. Circles with different colors indicate prefectures in Yunnan or other provinces or strains isolated in Burma. The year in which the isolate was obtained is indicated by the lineages. The numbers on the branches indicate the different numbers of R loci. If two neighboring types did not differ in more than 2 R loci, they would be surrounded by a halo of the same color. Based on the results of the A14 scheme, twelve variable number of tandem repeats (Rs) were further complementally used for source tracing of the related strains identified in Yunnan in 2016. An  was constructed to describe the diversity of the ). In general, the isolates associated with the reemergence of human plague in 2016 differed from the isolates that had previously been collected in the biovar orientalis plague epidemics. Yunnan Province borders Burma, Laos, and Vietnam, and it is also adjacent to the Guizhou, Guangxi, Tibet and Sichuan provinces in southwestern China. In the Yunnan  biovar orientalis strains in China; corresponding phylogenetic evidence supports the conclusion that human plague cases identified in Yunnan in 2016 originated from rats that died of plague. In epidemiological investigations, the use of reliable subtyping methods is a prerequisite for identifying links among isolates and for understanding the dynamics of pathogen spread. Different molecular genotyping methods based on different principles have different applications. For example, the  analysis, which is mainly based on horizontal gene transfer or gene loss []. A notable advantage of A typing is its flexibility. Different sets of R loci may be used to assess the performance of different phylogenetic investigations over different temporal or spatial scales. Previously described A methods included 25 and 42&#x2013;46 R loci [). Thus, based on the A14 data, the pathogen that caused the human case in Yunnan in 2016 was similar to the pathogens responsible for previous epidemics in Yunnan or other regions. Some researchers have investigated the possible mechanism of the interepizootic persistence of plague, such as the persistence of ]. In fact, any ecological disturbance that changes the dynamics of the main host or main vector, even human activities, such as agricultural activities or a mass slaughter of the rodents, could unleash a flood of homeless fleas that would then transfer to humans and domestic animals and infect them with plague. Interestingly, the cases of human plague that occurred in 2016 had a close relationship with the strains isolated in Dehong and Baoshan during the last  may have been imported into the affected region from neighboring areas. More detailed investigations, including ongoing biological and anthropologic investigations, are necessary, and genome-based analyses may also provide additional information regarding the origin and microevolution of this bacterium. The third plague pandemic caused by  biovar orientalis plague reemerged in China. Researchers should focus on the risks associated with animal or human plague, and an enhanced surveillance should be implemented in this area.

In seatrout (anadromous  Walbaum) in Chile. At present, the origin of the virus remains unknown. Nevertheless, the study highlights the value of safeguarding native fish by upholding natural and artificial barriers that hinder introduction and spread, on a local or national scale, of alien fish species and their pathogens. Accordingly, further investigations of freshwater reservoirs and interactions with farmed salmonids are warranted. Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (I) in Atlantic salmon (). In 2013, rainbow trout fingerlings from three different hatcheries in Norway showed disease signs and necropsy findings resembling I in Atlantic salmon. Gross necropsy findings were signs of circulatory disturbances including haemorrhages, ascites and anaemia, and histopathological findings comprised inflammation of the heart and red skeletal muscle and necrosis in the liver. Two of the hatcheries reported low to moderate mortality. The third hatchery reported 0.3% mortality in tanks without clinical signs, and up to 21% in tanks with diseased fish. Disease and related mortality was reported up to four months after sea transfer. Extended investigations, initiated due to the resemblance with I in Atlantic salmon, led to the identification of a virus with gene sequences sharing approximately 85% identity with  in Atlantic salmon and closely related a &#x2010;like virus in Coho salmon. Hence, both viruses probably belong to the same group with the suggested designation &#x2010;3 (Dhamotharan et al., ). Experimental infection studies have strengthened the association between &#x2010;3 and the disease signs seen in rainbow trout (Hauge et al., ). The infection transmitted to all of rainbow trout cohabitants that also developed disease symptoms. The virus seemed less adapted to Atlantic salmon, as less than 50% of the cohabitants were infected 8&#x2013;16&#xA0;weeks post&#x2010;challenge and experienced only minor lesions. Epidemiological investigations and &#x2010;based surveillance programmes show that &#x2010;3 is present at all levels of the marine rainbow trout production cycle, including broodfish, hatcheries and after sea transfer (Olsen et al., ) in pre&#x2010;alpine river systems in Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland has been associated with &#x2010;3. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority annually conducts health monitoring in wild salmonids. In 2017, the objective of the programme was to investigate the occurrence of &#x2010;3 in wild salmonids. Here we report the first detection of &#x2010;3 in wild seatrout ( L). A cross&#x2010;sectional study designed to investigate the occurrence of &#x2010;3 in wild adult anadromous and non&#x2010;anadromous salmonids in Norwegian watercourses was conducted (Table ). Overview of study sample including species, anadromousy, year and number of counties, watercourses and fish Map of Norway indicating the geographical locations where samples from landlocked salmon (diamond), anadromous salmon (circles), seatrout (squares), Arctic char (triangles) and brown trout (stars) were obtained.

() and reported as positive if Ct&#x2010;values are &lt;37. From each of the two regions, the two seatrout samples with lowest Ct&#x2010;values were selected for verification of positive real&#x2010;time &#x2010; findings by conventional &#x2010; with forward primer 5&#x2019;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;3&#x2019; and reverse primer 5&#x2019;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;&#x2010;3&#x2019; amplifying a 423&#xA0;bp fragment of the sigma 3 protein gene followed by Sanger sequencing and conditions as previously described (Olsen et al., ). The &#x2010;based screening showed that &#x2010;3 was present in wild seatrout (Table ). Three of 60 seatrout from the Vefsn region (Nordland County, 2011), 31 of 137 samples from Hardanger (Hordaland County, 2016) and finally ten of 68 samples from Hardanger (2017) were positive in real&#x2010;time &#x2010; for detection of &#x2010;3. Altogether, 44 virus&#x2010;positive seatrout were detected in 15 of 21 rivers and in both regions included in the study. Ct&#x2010;values ranged from 22.5 to 39.6. The &#x2010;results of two samples from Vefsn and two samples from Hardanger 2016 were verified by repeated real&#x2010;time &#x2010; performed on re&#x2010;extracted nucleic acids. Subsequent sequencing and  search against the GenBank database showed that all four samples from seatrout had 99%&#x2013;100% identity with &#x2010;3 in rainbow trout (GenBank accession number 680851). One sequence from each region was submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers 061361 (River Hund&#xE5;la/Vefsn) and 061362 (River Sima/Hardanger). None of the examined samples from seatrout were positive for &#x2010;1. Overview of results from real&#x2010;time &#x2010;analyses for &#x2010;3 in seatrout (anadromous trout  ).  results are presented as the proportion of test&#x2010;positive among tested (test&#x2010;positive/Number tested). In wild Atlantic salmon, &#x2010;3 was detected in four of 221 samples with Ct&#x2010;values close to the limit of detection (34.6&#x2013;40). These results could not be confirmed by sequencing due to low amount of viral . Positive samples originated from three rivers in the Hardanger region. Two of these were also positive for &#x2010;1. In total, &#x2010;3 was present in seatrout from 15 of 21 investigated rivers and in both the northern and southern region (Figure ). Accordingly, this study strongly suggests that &#x2010;3 is a common virus in seatrout in both regions. The prevalence of &#x2010;3 is different between the two regions, with 20% virus&#x2010;positive in Hardanger and 5% in the Vefsn region. This may reflect actual differences between regions or confounding factors. There is an inherent bias caused by the possibility of virus transmission during cohabitation in tanks in the material from Hardanger. The two regions also differ in year of sampling, 2016/2017 versus 2011, but it is probably more important that seatrout from the Vefsn region comprise a sample of adult seatrout dead due to rotenone exposure in august 2011 (Anonymous, ). Nevertheless, the virus is present in 13 of 17 rivers (76.5%) in Hardanger and in two of four rivers in the Vefsn region, hence the conclusion that &#x2010;3 is common in seatrout sustains. Screening of all life stages of seatrout and in new regions would add more knowledge. None of the &#x2010;3 positive seatrout selected for &#x2010;1 analyses were &#x2010;positive. Previous studies have shown that approximately 1%&#x2013;3% of seatrout are &#x2010;1&#x2010;positive (Garseth, Fritsvold, Opheim, Skjerve, &amp; Biering, , two clades of &#x2010;3 are present. Unfortunately, we were not able to assign sequences to specific clades. Transmission trials have shown that &#x2010;3 is less adapted to Atlantic salmon than rainbow trout (Hauge et al., ). Cohabitation in tanks with infected seatrout could be a bias in the study. However, none of the &#x2010;3 positive salmon were kept in tanks with &#x2010;3 positive seatrout. None of the 11 anadromous Arctic char were virus&#x2010;positive. However, the sample size was low and only suitable for detecting highly prevalent pathogens (Cameron &amp; Baldock, ). Altogether, 79 brown trout from three non&#x2010;anadromous lakes were tested without detecting &#x2010;3. Similarly, the virus was absent in 40 non&#x2010;anadromous (landlocked) salmon (Table ). This could mean that salmonids in relatively na&#x;ve non&#x2010;anadromous watercourses are of minor importance as a reservoir. &#x2010;3 is nevertheless common in seatrout from anadromous watercourses, meaning that rainbow trout farms that use these water sources are at risk. In Norway, farming of rainbow trout takes place as two nearly separate production lines: the freshwater&#x2010;based small&#x2010;scale inland aquaculture (based on of roe from the marine production), and the large&#x2010;scale marine production along the coast, where juvenile stages are produced in freshwater. In the marine aquaculture of rainbow trout, &#x2010;3 is present at all stages of the production cycle, including hatcheries that do not use sea water in their production (Olsen et al., ). At any given time, there are approximately 20&#xA0;million (35,000 metric tonnes) of sea&#x2010;farmed rainbow trout present in Norwegian coastal waters (Directorate of fisheries; Statistics for aquaculture 2018). The high number and biomass of susceptible and infected farmed hosts represents a considerable potential for virus propagation. Accordingly, seatrout that are exposed to effluents from hatcheries or infected coastal waters are at risk. Both counties represented in this study have a steady production of rainbow trout in the sea (Directorate of fisheries; Statistics for aquaculture 2018), and sequences obtained from wild seatrout had 99%&#x2013;100% identity with &#x2010;3 in rainbow trout. Accordingly, virus transmission between seatrout and farmed and escaped rainbow trout is likely to occur. The freshwater&#x2010;based inland aquaculture takes place adjacent important native freshwater fish stocks, including stocks of brown trout. Thus far, the occurrence of &#x2010;3 in inland aquaculture of rainbow trout and wild stocks in these areas has not been studied. Reports from continental Europe provide evidence that &#x2010;3 is present in inland farming of rainbow trout and brown trout (Adamek et al., ) elaborate on the sequence identity of &#x2010;3 found in seatrout. Further investigations of freshwater resident wild and farmed populations in Norway are therefore necessary. In a broader perspective, it is interesting to discuss &#x2010;3 encountered in Norwegian seatrout and rainbow trout and the similarities with &#x2010;3 in Chilean Coho salmon. Historically, rainbow trout, but also European  have been introduced and released in Chile and could thus have introduced the virus. On the other hand, global trade of fish and eggs is an ongoing activity and will always represent a risk of introduction of both alien fish species and their pathogens. The results from this study therefore highlight the value of safeguarding native fish species by upholding natural and artificial barriers that hinder introduction and spread of alien fish species and their pathogens. Piscine orthoreovirus subtype 3 (&#x2010;3) is a common virus in seatrout in Norway. Compared to rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon are less susceptible to the virus, which may explain the low prevalence and viral loads recorded in wild specimen in this study. The absence of &#x2010;3 in both non&#x2010;anadromous ) referred to &#x2010;3 as a rainbow trout associated virus. This study strongly supports an association with seatrout. No conflict of interest has been identified for any of the authors. Thanks to the Genebank for wild Atlantic salmon and two stock enhancement hatcheries that provided broodfish samples to the study.

When comparing with the mammalian counterpart,  has been reported to counteract the antiviral response in several ways to support its own replication. Mechanisms of interaction include binding and inactivation of 3 by the  &#x3; protein (). The long lasting transcription of interferon-regulated genes in -infected  salmon indicates that  does not effectively block interferon production or interferon-mediated stimulation of antiviral gene expression in Atlantic salmon . However, there may be a block at the translational level. The persistence of   along with an apparent block in progeny production points toward ineffective eradication of infected , while viral dissemination appears to be held back by innate immune mechanisms. When comparing antiviral responses to -1 and -3 cross-species, data so far indicate that the magnitude of innate antiviral responses corresponds to virulence in the respective target species (-1 in  salmon and -3 in rainbow trout). Although -1 can replicate intensely in Coho salmon and Sockeye salmon (). Similarly, -3 replicates in Atlantic salmon blood but induce weak antiviral response. This implies that the pathologic effects of  infection could be coupled to the ability to induce antiviral immune responses in the host. Anemia is reported as a hallmark for -2 infected Coho salmon, and typical for -3 infected farmed rainbow trout (), possibly due to hemoglobin reduction. The transcriptome study of -1 infected s indicated a general decrease in the expression of a range of functional gene groups. Although not fully understood in relation to implications, the expression patterns strongly indicated that  infection repressed genes that controlled erythrocyte shape/cytoskeleton, tissue interaction/adhesion, cell-cell communication/cytokines/chemokines and metabolism (), and could be partly responsible for this effect. Among the genes less suppressed by the infection were genes directly related to heme and hemoglobin synthesis, which supports the hypothesis that the hemoglobin reduction associated with S and I is primarily due to post trancriptional effects. Strong reduction in adhesion molecule expression implies that the ability of  to interact with muscle tissue for oxygen delivery could be affected, and thereby add to the physiological consequences of hemoglobin reduction. When keeping in mind that a translational inhibition may further add to suppression at the transcriptional level, disturbed gas exchange to muscle tissue would not be a surprising result. Clarifying if these findings are coupled to -mediated disease will be an important step forward. In addition, the study of  infection is a key to understanding the immunological role of fish erythrocytes. &#xD8;W wrote about  virus, Figure , read and approved the manuscript.  wrote about transcriptome data, read and approved the manuscript.  wrote about  virus, read and approved the manuscript.  coordinated the draft, wrote about disease, immunology and erythrocyte functions, read and approved the manuscript.

As Subnational Reference Laboratory of the Measles and Rubella surveillance work (MoRo), the EpiSo (Epidemiology and Molecular Surveillance of Infections) Laboratory (University of Milan) set up rapid and active surveillance for the complete characterisation of the Measles virus (Mv) responsible for the large measles outbreak in Milan and surrounding areas (Lombardy, Northern Italy). The aims of this study were to describe the genetic profile of circulating viruses and to track the pathway of measles transmission. Molecular analysis was performed by sequencing the highly variable 450 nucleotides region of the N gene (N-450) of Mv genome. Two-hundred and ninety-nine strains of Mv were analysed. The phylogenetic analysis showed five different variants, two not previously described in the studied area, belonging to D8 and B3 genotypes. Three events of continuous transmission of autochthonous variants (D8-Osaka, D8-London and B3-Milan variants) and two events of continuous transmission of imported variants (B3-Dublin and D8-Hulu Langat) tracked five different transmission pathways. These pathways outlined two epidemic peaks: the first in April and the second in July 2017. The correlation between Mv variant and the epidemiological data may enable us to identify the sources of virus importation and recognise long-lasting virus transmission pathways. The World Health Organization () planned to eliminate measles by 2015, but due to the numerous measles outbreak in the European Region in the last few years this did not occur []. The process of verification of elimination will be based on documented evidence of the interruption of endemic measles transmission at national level []. Mv is a negative-sense, single-stranded  virus belonging to the ]. The correlation between genetic and epidemiological data may enable us to identify the sources of virus importation and recognise long-lasting virus transmission pathways. In 2017, Italy experienced a large measles epidemic with 5408 cases and four deaths [] in the Lombardy Region, EpiSo Laboratory set up rapid and active surveillance for the complete characterisation of the Mv virus responsible for the large measles outbreak in Milan and surrounding areas (Lombardy, Italy), which is a highly populated area with nearly 4 million inhabitants. From 1 March to 31 December 2017, 321 measles cases were laboratory-confirmed, 162 were sporadic cases and 159 were related to 75 outbreaks. The phylogenetic analysis enables us to establish whether links exist between concurrent measles cases. The aims of this study were to describe the genetic profile of circulating viruses and to track the pathway of measles transmission. Total  was extracted from urine and oral fluid using the NucliS&#x; easy&#x2122; automated platform (bioM&#xE9;rieux bv, Lyon, France) according to the off-board lysis protocol. The amplification of a highly variable 450 nt sequence encoding the C-terminal part of the N gene (N-450) was performed []. The first step was carried out under the following amplification reaction conditions: 5&#xA0;min denaturation at 94&#xA0;&#xB0;C followed by 35 cycles of amplification. Each cycle consisted in a denaturation step at 94&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s, an annealing step at 56&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s and an elongation step at 72&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 45&#xA0;s.

N-450 nucleotide sequences were analysed using the ]. Virus genotypes were designated according to the official  nomenclature and the sequences were submitted to the Mea database []. Genotype as well as variant assignments were based on a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. The Mv genotype A strain &#x2018;s/Vaccine/Edmonston/&#x2019; was used as an outgroup. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal X [ generation and a burn-in fraction of 50%. Statistical support for specific clades was obtained by calculating the posterior probability (pp) of each monophyletic clade, and a posterior consensus tree was generated after a 50% burn-in. The tree was visualised and edited using Figtree software v 1.4.1. Descriptive data on measles cases were obtained from the Lombardy Region database. According to the national surveillance guidelines, the Lombardy Region Surveillance System requires physicians to report all suspected measles cases to the Local Health Units (s) within 12&#xA0;h from the onset of symptoms. The s are responsible for carrying out all epidemiological investigations and collecting specimens from each suspected case. The personal data, clinical details and epidemiological status of each notified case were systematically reported to the Lombardy Region database. The data obtained were used to distinguish between sporadic cases or outbreaks and between indigenous, imported or imported-related cases. We matched the epidemiological data with the genetic profile of the strains and the following definitions were used to classify the epidemic events: , events involving the continuous transmission of the same virus variant (autochthonous or imported) in a selected geographic area in a limited period; , group of viruses with identical or nearly identical N-450 nucleotide sequences present in a selected geographic area and identified in non-imported cases; , group of viruses with identical or nearly identical N-450 nucleotide sequences previously not identified in a selected geographic area and identified in imported or import-related cases. Two-hundred and ninety-nine out of 321 (93.1%) confirmed cases (163 were classified as sporadic and 159 clustered in 75 different outbreaks) were successfully genotyped by sequencing the N-450 region. The -n analysis revealed that the sequences belonged to genotypes D8 and B3. The most frequently detected genotype was D8 (248/299, 82.9%).

Moreover, the D8-London is a named strain firstly identified in London in May 2016 (Mvs/LondonR/21.16/2) and then observed for the first time in Milan in May 2017 (s/MilanA/22.17/2, pp&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.94). D8 sequences belonging to the named strain Hulu Langat and that related to this named strain, grouped significantly outside the variant D8-Osaka (pp&#xA0;=&#xA0;1) (similarity range: 99.8&#x2013;100%). The 51 B3 sequences were closely related (pp&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.93): 45 belonged to the  named strain Dublin (s/DublinL/8.16) and one was closely related to it (similarity: 99.8%). The remaining five sequences, temporarily called B3-Milan variant (s/MilanA/35.17), grouped significantly (pp&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.94) and were identical to each other. Epidemic curves of five different pathways of transmission sustained by five different variants from March to December 2017, in the surrounding areas and in the city of Milan. The D8-Osaka was the prevalent variant identified in 146 autochthonous cases. In particular, 58 were notified as sporadic cases while 88 were involved in 47 outbreaks. Events of continuous transmission of D8-Osaka were observed from March (s/MilanA/09.17) to November (s/MonzaBrianzaA/47.17) 2017. Initially, the variant spread within the community and later spread in hospital settings. In March 2017, a serious outbreak affected three family members causing the death of one of them. The D8-Osaka was isolated from the biological samples of one of these cases. In June 2017, the same variant infected a transplant patient who developed late neurological sequelae and died in January 2018. This previously undetected variant was identified in 94 autochthonous cases, 59 were notified as sporadic cases and 35 were related to 20 outbreaks. Events involving the continuous transmission of this strain were detected from June (s/MilanA/22.17/2) to October (s/MonzaBrianzaA/41.17) 2017. The named strain was mainly spread in hospital settings. This strain was detected in 45 cases, 27 were notified as sporadic cases while 18 cases were related to nine outbreaks. Five cases out of 45 were imported, one case was imported-related and 39 cases were autochthonous. The B3-Dublin was imported during March/April 2017 from various European countries (France, Romania) and Italian Regions (Apulia, Lazio, Piedmont), and successively caused imported-related outbreaks and then became established in the area, causing autochthonous cases. Events of continuous transmission of this variant peaked in July 2017, due to several nosocomial outbreaks. The last identification of the B3-Dublin was in September 2017 (s/MilanA/36.17/3). This variant was detected in two sporadic cases, of which one was notified as imported. The D8-Hulu-Langat strain was imported from South Africa in September 2017 (s/ComoA/38.17); in October 2017 this variant was detected in one case (s/MonzaBrianzaA/41.17/2) that was not epidemiologically travel-associated since the source of infection remains unknown. This previously undetected variant (s/MilanA/35.17) was identified in five autochthonous cases, three cases were involved in a family outbreak and two sporadic cases. This variant was only observed in September 2017. A large measles epidemic occurred in Milan in 2017. In this study, we reconstructed the transmission pathways by matching the genetic profile of circulating Mv strains with epidemiological data. Two different genotypes were identified: D8 and B3. The time of arrival of the D8 genotype in the area under study was estimated and dates back to March 1987 []. The phylogenetic analysis identified five different clusters: three belonging to the D8 genotype (D8-Osaka variant, D8-London named strain and D8-Hulu Langat variant) and two of the B3 genotype (B3-Dublin named strain and B3-Milan variant). Two epidemic peaks were observed in April and July 2017. The first peak was mainly caused by the autochthonous D8-Osaka named strain. This named strain was described for the first time in Osaka, Japan in 2015 and was detected in Europe from 2016 onwards (in Germany, the Netherland and Switzerland). At the beginning of 2017, the D8-Osaka named strain was identified in several Italian Regions (Lazio, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Lombardy). It was the most prevalent in Milan and the surrounding areas and caused severe clinical courses and deaths. Several D8-Osaka cases were notified as sporadic cases, however the genetic profile suggested that it was a single large outbreak. The second epidemic peak was characterised by the co-circulation of two different variants, the D8-London and the B3-Dublin named strain. The D8-London caused the highest number of cases, all were autochthonous cases. This named strain, which is phylogenetically related to the D8-Osaka variant, was observed for the first time in Milan in May 2017. A few weeks later, it caused an epidemic event in Finland where it was imported by an Italian student []. The D8-London named strain has caused events of long-lasting continuous transmission (June&#x2013;September 2017) in Milan where it was disproportionally amplified by five nosocomial outbreaks. The B3-Dublin caused the important outbreak in Romania in 2016&#x2013;2017. In 2017, this named strain spread across all of the European countries []). The genetic identification of circulating viruses enabled us to highlight the simultaneous occurrence of three different outbreaks caused by three variants (autochthonous or imported) in Milan and the surrounding area. It is important to note that the D8-Osaka, D8-London and B3-Dublin named strains were associated with 12 nosocomial outbreaks which probably facilitated virus spread and the amplification of the virus in the community setting []. Genotyping, phylogenetic analysis and the study of the epidemic curves could be considered important tools to follow the progress towards elimination. In fact, this multiple approach enables us to track the introduction of imported strains, to observe their persistence in a defined geographic area and highlight the occurrence of large epidemics and their periodic patterns.

Although significant improvements have been observed since the introduction of vaccines, measles remains endemic in Romania. Contributing factors include vaccine hesitancy, difficulties in delivering doses to the population, and even the lack of sufficient vaccine supplies. These problems are further exacerbated by an inadequate implementation of public health measures, ranging from inefficient communication programs to the absence of a legislative framework concerning immunization. Moreover, many of the recent outbreaks were associated with chains of transmission in other countries, thus making the control of measles in Romania relevant at an international level. As many difficulties exist, understanding the key factors that limit the success of public health programs may provide guidance in shaping future strategies. Because similar issues are being faced in various other countries, the management of measles in Romania offers valuable lessons for researchers and policy-makers alike. Measles is a highly infectious viral disease which can result in severe complications and even death (). However, for this to be achieved, a very high vaccination coverage (&gt;95%) needs to be achieved and maintained for extensive periods of time. In Romania, the first dose of the monovalent measles-containing vaccine (1) was introduced in 1979 for children aged 9&#x2013;11 months, and the second dose (2) was implemented in 1994 for children 6&#x2013;7 years of age (). Annual measles incidence and  coverage in Romania from . Estimates for 1 coverage are only from 1983 onwards, and 2 coverage estimates are unavailable before the year 2000. Coverage data for 2018 unavailable at the time of writing. Although these public health strategies have achieved and maintained a high vaccination coverage, outbreaks of variable severity have still been taking place, sometimes exhibiting elevated levels of mortality, especially in young children (). Cumulatively, these factors delayed accurate diagnosis and appropriate containment, thereby allowing measles to spread at a faster rate than the authorities could provide efficient intervention and control. In this paper, a synthesis of the available information about measles in Romania is provided. Recent outbreaks, some of their underlying factors, and specific control measures are presented in order to illustrate the successes and failures of national public health strategies. At the same time, possible solutions are assessed in terms of their potential to limit the impact of future epidemics. After the introduction of the measles-containing vaccine in 1979, the dynamics of the disease changed, exhibiting a decreased annual incidence and longer inter-epidemic periods (see ). As such, the most notable outbreaks of the twentieth century were the ones with peak incidences in 1982, 1986, 1993, and 1997. Although the disease burden caused by measles had decreased substantially in Romania by the beginning of the current millennium, the epidemics of 2004&#x2013;2007 and 2011&#x2013;2013 deserve attention, as well as the one that began in 2016 (). The measles outbreak of 2016 resulted in more than 15,500 cases with a total of 59 deaths by the end of 2018 (). As such, the primary cases of some recent outbreaks in Ireland, Greece, Bulgaria, and Belgium were either of Romanian nationality or had traveled to Romania before becoming infectious. Therefore, it is important to note that Romania poses an increased risk of acting as a reservoir for measles, having the potential to seed epidemics on an international scale. The 2016 Romanian measles epidemic. . As no specific treatment for measles exists, vaccination remains the only effective measure in combating this disease (). This was mostly the result of an insufficient national stock of vaccines, and thus there is an impending need for the authorities to ensure that enough doses are available to the population, especially in the case of an ongoing measles outbreak. In response to measles epidemics, additional vaccination campaigns have been conducted over the years to supplement the national program (). However, variable degrees of success were observed. For example, by the end of May 2017, a high vaccination coverage with the first dose (98.9%) was obtained in children 1&#x2013;4 years of age in the Timis county. In contrast, only 62.5% of children aged 5&#x2013;9 years were immunized with the first dose, and only 39.1% received the second inoculation. Moreover, in Caras-Severin (then one of the most affected counties), a mere 31.4% of children aged 1&#x2013;4 years were vaccinated with the first dose and only 15.3 and 17.6% of children aged 5&#x2013;9 years received the first and second vaccines, respectively. Therefore, the delivery of the doses to the population remains an important issue, particularly during epidemics. An additional problem is represented by the low vaccine uptake in vulnerable communities, and more targeted measures would be needed to achieve good immunization coverage in these populations (). The declining trends in vaccination coverage in the context of the recent measles epidemics have also constituted the basis for recurrent discussions about mandatory immunization (). However, because individual freedoms are usually concerned, it is important to emphasize that such measures might not be viewed favorably by the public. Therefore, if the social, economic, and cultural factors are not evaluated appropriately, a legal enforcement of vaccination may lead to public unrest and the inability to deliver the desired outcomes. Medical practitioners are offered regular training sessions by the county branches of the Romanian National Institute of Public Health (P), which are aimed at providing them with skills in vaccine delivery and in communicating with patients (). Overall, the majority of the public (83%) believes that immunizing children as part of the national vaccination strategy is beneficial, according to a social study carried out in 2017 (). The individuals placed corruption, insufficient staffing, and the inadequate supply of medication among the top five problems of the national healthcare system. Cumulatively, these perceptions may impact the effectiveness of all public health programs in Romania, including the management and control of vaccine-preventable diseases. Religious arguments have also been used against vaccination on many occasions. According to a 2011 census, more than 85% of the population identified as Orthodox Christian, and this factor is likely to influence the views of the public concerning immunization (). The global anti-vaccine movement has also become more prevalent in Romania in recent years (). Furthermore, assessing the main factors that are presented as arguments against vaccination would allow for more efficient strategies concerning both immunizations and raising awareness. This information may also facilitate the identification of specific subsets of the population, thus enabling more targeted measures to be designed for maximizing the efficiency of national public health programs. There are a multitude of factors contributing to the negative outcomes of the prevention and control of measles in Romania, such as difficulties in vaccine delivery, the public's views on immunization, and even the absence of a legislative framework regarding vaccination. Consequently, although an elaborate methodology exists, most of the outbreaks that have occurred in recent years often failed to be contained in an appropriate way. With this in mind, the outcomes of public health measures in Romania will strictly depend on the way in which current and future policies will be implemented. The results will be contingent on thorough evaluations of existing methodologies, efficient public awareness campaigns, adequate intervention strategies, and more targeted measures toward vulnerable subsets of the population. Regarding this latter factor, conducting community-level serosurveys might have the potential to identify individuals that are at high risk of infection with measles. At the same time, understanding why people are hesitant about, or actively opposed to vaccination may provide invaluable insights for designing tactics to address these problems. Currently, it remains to be seen how Romanian politicians, public health authorities, and members of the civil society will address these issues in the upcoming years. Because similar problems are being faced on an international scale, the lessons learned from the measles epidemics in Romania may provide guidance in shaping future strategies not only for the Romanian authorities, but also for other countries that are challenged by this disease.

To improve health care provider communication and vaccine recommendation practices with hesitant parents, it is important to understand how providers perceive parental  vaccine hesitancy. This study aimed to characterize perceived reasons for parental  vaccine hesitancy and identify factors associated with perceived parental hesitancy among providers at community-based pediatric clinics. In 2018, providers in 23 community-based pediatric clinics in Tennessee were invited to complete a Web-based baseline survey as part of a larger quality improvement study focused on  vaccine uptake. These survey data were used for a cross-sectional, secondary data analysis. Scale scores ranging from 0 to 100 were calculated for provider self-efficacy (confidence in ability to recommend  vaccine), provider outcome expectations (expectations that recommendation will influence parents&#x2019; decisions), and perceived parental  vaccine hesitancy. Provider confidence in  vaccine safety and effectiveness were categorized as high versus low. Clinic-level exposures examined were clinic size and rural-urban location. Descriptive analyses were used to characterize perceived parental barriers by provider type. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fit taking one exposure variable at a time, whereas controlling for provider type, age, gender, and race to identify provider- and clinic-level factors associated with perceived parental barriers to  vaccination. Of the 187 providers located in the 23 clinics, 137 completed the survey. The majority of physician providers were white and female, with a higher percentage of females among nurse practitioners (s) and physician assistants (s). The most common parental barriers to  vaccination perceived by providers were concerns about  vaccine safety (88%), child being too young (78%), low risk of  infection for child through sexual activity (70%), and mistrust in vaccines (59%). In adjusted mixed models, perceived parental  vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with several provider-level factors: . Researchers developing provider-focused interventions to reduce parental  vaccine hesitancy should consider addressing providers&#x2019; self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and confidence in  vaccine safety to help providers communicate more effectively with  vaccine hesitant parents. Human papillomavirus () vaccination coverage remains alarmingly low. In 2017, only 49% of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years in the United States completed the recommended doses of the  vaccine []. Therefore, understanding sources of parental hesitancy is important to develop strategies to address their concerns. A growing literature has begun to explore  vaccine hesitancy among parents in recent years. Common reasons for  vaccine hesitancy reported by parents include misinformation, lack of or varying recommendation, lack of knowledge, and concerns about vaccine safety and side effects []. A previous study found a mismatch between provider and parental ratings of how much importance parents placed on  vaccine, with providers substantially overestimating the parental  vaccine hesitancy []. Thus, it is important to examine provider-level variation in how they perceive parental  vaccine hesitancy, given that many providers may not perceive parents&#x2019; level of hesitancy accurately and that their perceptions of parental hesitancy are associated with provider-level variation in  vaccination rates. Yet, research to date has not identified the factors that influence provider perceptions of parental  vaccine hesitancy. These factors could be targets for interventions to improve provider communication and recommendation practices. A previous study found that routine provider recommendations for the  vaccine were more likely to occur with providers who had a high confidence in their ability to recommend the vaccine and address parental concerns (ie, high context-specific self-efficacy). Providers with high expectations of their recommendations resulting in parents accepting the vaccine for their children (ie, high outcome expectations) were also more likely to recommend the  vaccine routinely []); and (2) parent-provider interactions may influence perceptions of physician versus nonphysician providers differently and how they recommend the vaccine. Clinic-level factors could also potentially affect perceived parental  vaccine hesitancy. For example, rural areas have lower  vaccination coverage compared with urban areas []. Therefore, the size of clinic could influence the length and type of patient-provider interactions, which indirectly affects providers&#x2019; perceived parental  vaccine hesitancy. However, no studies to our knowledge have identified specific factors that influence the types and level of parental  vaccine hesitancy that providers perceive and whether those factors vary by provider type. The aim of this study was to characterize the reasons for and level of parental  vaccine hesitancy as perceived by pediatric providers at community-based, private pediatric clinics in Middle Tennessee. This study also aimed to identify provider-level and clinic-level factors influencing perceived parental hesitancy according to providers. The research question was: &#x201C;What are the provider and clinic characteristics associated with perceived parental hesitancy among pediatric providers within community-based pediatric clinics in Middle Tennessee, surveyed from January to March 2018?&#x201D; We hypothesized that perceived  vaccine hesitancy would be higher among providers who have lower self-efficacy, lower outcome expectations, lower confidence in  vaccine safety, and lower confidence  vaccine effectiveness. We also hypothesized that perceived  vaccine hesitancy would be higher among clinics that were larger and are located in small towns that serve rural areas. Study findings can be used to develop interventions that assist providers in effectively engaging  vaccine hesitant parents to improve acceptance and vaccination outcomes. This cross-sectional study used secondary data from 137 health care providers who provide care in 23 community-based pediatric clinics in Middle Tennessee. These providers are a part of an ongoing quality improvement parent study designed to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of 2 approaches to delivering quality improvement coaching focused on  vaccination, namely, Web-based coaching versus in-person coaching. As part of that parent study, providers completed a baseline survey that was collected from January to March 2018. This survey asked the providers questions related to  vaccine uptake in their clinics, their perceptions and attitudes related to  vaccine (eg, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations), and demographic characteristics of providers. Clinic location (rural/urban) was determined based on the clinic address and clinic size was reported by the clinic. For this study, we analyzed data from the baseline provider survey data. This study was approved by Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Boards. The population was composed of providers from 23 private, community-based pediatric practices located across the Middle Tennessee Region that were members of Cumberland Pediatric Foundation (). As a nonprofit organization,  applies scientific, charitable, and educational approaches to improve health care services for children. The foundation currently serves approximately 700 physicians, 70 practices, and 40 counties []. Practices were recruited for the parent study at events held by  or face-to-face by the research team. After practices made a practice-level decision to be in the trial, the providers were asked to take part in the survey. Providers included pediatricians, s, and s. The study inclusion criteria included all providers at each clinic, male or female, as they all provide  vaccines. None of the providers in the study clinics were excluded. Adapted from McRee et al (2015) [] developed the items using cognitive interviews with health care providers but did not report on psychometric properties of the scale. As there were no other validated measures for self-efficacy, we used this measure. In our sample, the self-efficacy scale demonstrated good internal consistency with Cronbach alpha=.79. The outcome expectations measure, adapted from McRee et al (2015) [], and we chose this measure because there were no other validated measures for outcome expectations. In our sample, the outcome expectations scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach alpha=.65. Confidence in the  vaccine safety was measured at the provider level using a single ordinal item created by the research team asking: &#x201C;Last year  how confident were you personally in the safety of the  vaccine for preventing cancer?&#x201D; Response options were on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very low to very high, and, before the analysis, the item responses were recoded using a range of 0 to 100 (0=very low, 25=somewhat low, 50=neutral or not sure, 75=high, and 100=very high). Higher scores indicated greater levels of confidence in the  vaccine safety. For a multivariate analysis, the variable was dichotomized to compare very high with other categories. This was measured at the provider level with a single ordinal item created by the research team that asked: &#x201C;Last year  how confident were you personally in the effectiveness of  vaccine for preventing cancer?&#x201D; Responses on a 5-point Likert scale ranged from very low to very high, and the scores were recoded using a range of 0 to 100 with 0=very low, 25=somewhat low, 50=neutral or not sure, 75=high, and 100=very high, as with the other scales. Higher scores mean greater levels of confidence in  vaccine effectiveness. This variable was dichotomized to compare very high with other categories for multivariate analysis. This is a continuous variable at the clinic level, which represents the total number of providers, as reported by each clinic. Providers included physicians, s, and s in each clinic. In total, 2 categorical variables at the clinic level were categorized based on the address of each clinic and 2 different  Census Bureau designations that reflect degree of urbanization. A metropolitan statistical area () is a geographic area that is associated with a least one urbanized area that has a population of at least 50,000 []. Each clinic was assigned values for the 2 separate variables based on the physical address as follows: (1)  versus non- and (2) town/rural area (urbanized cluster) versus city (urbanized area). This is the primary outcome variable for this study. For this variable, we calculated a sum score from 7-items representing possible parental concerns, for which the providers rated how much they thought each one was a barrier to immunizing their patients against  (eg, parental concerns about  vaccine safety and parental mistrust of vaccines in general). The responses for each item were on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from not a barrier at all to a major barrier. Before the analysis, the scores of the individual items were recoded by using a 0 to 100 range with 0=not a barrier at all, 33=a minor barrier, 67=somewhat of a barrier, and 100=a major barrier, for consistency with the other scales that were measured using 4-point Likert scales. Higher scores represented greater levels of perceived parental hesitancy. This measure was adopted from Farias et al (2017) []. The authors did not report on the process used to develop the items or the psychometric properties of the scale. We selected this measure as we could not locate any other validated measures for perceived parental hesitancy for providers. In our sample, the provider-perceived parental hesitancy scale demonstrated good internal consistency with Cronbach alpha=.73. Provider age was a continuous variable measured in years. Providers self-identified their race/ethnicity as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, or other. To create a dichotomous variable for race for this analysis, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and other were combined in the category  depicts the relationship between all of the variables. Depiction of variables. : human papillomavirus. First, for descriptive purposes, provider-level demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender) were summarized for the overall sample and compared by provider type (ie, physicians and s/s) using Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher&#x2019;s exact test for categorical/binary variables. Continuous variables were summarized with median and quartiles, and categorical variables were summarized with frequencies and proportions. Second, for descriptive purposes, each of the individual items representing provider-perceived barriers of parental  vaccine hesitancy was summarized using frequencies and proportions, and also compared by provider type using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Next, the outcome variable (ie, perceived  vaccine hesitancy scale) and the exposure variables were summarized for the total sample with median and quartiles for continuous variables, and with frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. The outcome and exposures were compared by provider type, using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher&#x2019;s exact test. The objective of the primary analysis was to identify provider- and clinic-level factors associated with parental  vaccine hesitancy as perceived by providers. To estimate the associations between the outcome and the provider-level exposure variables of interest (ie, self-efficacy, outcome expectation, confidence in  vaccine efficacy, and confidence in  vaccine safety), a multilevel linear regression model was fit, taking one exposure variable at a time. We used linear mixed-effects models to account for clustering at the clinic level (ie, correlations between observations from the same clinic) through a random effect. Due to small numbers of responses in some of the categories, confidence in efficacy and confidence-in-safety variables were dichotomized into v]. The survey was sent to all 187 providers located within the 23 clinics. Of these, 137 completed the survey, and all were used in this analysis except for 1 participant that did not finish the survey and had incomplete data. ).

We characterized perceived reasons for parental  vaccine hesitancy as perceived by pediatric providers. Not surprisingly, we found that the majority of providers perceived  vaccine safety, mistrust in vaccines, low perceived risk for  via sexual contact, and child&#x2019;s young age as major parental barriers to  vaccination. A handful of previous studies have sought to characterize perceived barriers to  vaccine hesitancy according to providers [], further research is needed on a larger scale, statewide and nationally, to monitor perceived parental barriers according to providers and by type. This will continue to inform intervention targets and establish generalizability of our findings. In addition, future studies should identify if providers are overestimating and misinterpreting reasons for parental hesitancy compared with actual parent-reported sources of parental hesitancy to be used as intervention targets. This study was the first to identify if perceived reasons for parental  vaccine hesitancy varied by the type of pediatric provider. We observed significant differences in perceived barriers (ie, concern of their child getting too many shots during a visit and being too young to get the vaccine) by provider type. These findings suggest parental perceived barriers can vary across providers, with physicians more likely to perceive these as a major barrier. A possible explanation for this variation could be if the type of educational training related to vaccine hesitancy differs between physicians and other providers. In addition, physicians may have experienced different interactions with parents compared with other providers, which may lead to differences in perceived parental barriers. Hence, tailored strategies or messages by provider type could be used in interventions to assist them in addressing  vaccine parents. In this sample, the majority of the providers had high to very high levels of confidence in  vaccine safety and effectiveness, as well as high levels of outcome expectations and self-efficacy. The level of outcome expectations and self-efficacy was similar to another study []. Due to the role these factors play in providers perceiving lower parental hesitancy, interventions aimed at training providers on how to address  vaccine hesitancy may benefit from targeting provider confidence in safety, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to also identify provider and clinic-level factors associated with perceived parental barriers to  vaccine hesitancy according to providers. One explanation for the positive association between perceived parental barriers and self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and confidence in vaccine safety could be that providers who engage in unsuccessful encounters with  vaccine hesitant parents increase their perceived parental barriers to  vaccination while lowering their self-efficacy and outcome expectations. Furthermore, providers with low confidence in  vaccine safety may unintentionally transfer their own uncertainty to the parents of their patients and perceive that parents are more hesitant than they actually are []. Surprisingly, in viewing clinic-level factors associated with perceived provider barriers, clinic location was not found statistically significant. In 2017, rural areas had lower coverage rates for receipt of the first dose of the  vaccine compared with urban areas, with a difference of 11 percentage points []. This raises the question of whether  vaccination is lower in rural areas because parental hesitancy is more prevalent, or because providers are less likely to recommend the vaccine or recommend it effectively in rural areas due to perceived parental barriers to  vaccination. As physicians play a key role in parental acceptance, the lack of association here warrants more research to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing physician recommendations in rural areas. This study was not without limitations. First, this was a cross-sectional study with a &#x201C;snapshot&#x201D; captured of factors influencing perceived parental  vaccine hesitancy according to pediatric providers. Therefore, we could only examine associations and not causality. Perceived provider hesitancy could also influence the independent variables, and given the cross-sectional and correlational design, we could not test direction of causality. Nevertheless, this study contributes valuable information to the literature as the first to examine this question, and future research is needed to explore potential bidirectional relationships with the outcome variable using a longitudinal design or more complex relationships using a qualitative research. Second, we had a convenience sample of clinics and providers in Tennessee who participated in the larger study in 2018. Thus, the sample was limited to a subset of the pediatric provider population (ie, primarily white and female). The specific context of time and place could limit the generalizability of results to other regions of the country, given that Tennessee has relatively low levels of  vaccination; furthermore, perceived parental vaccine hesitancy could change over time as vaccination coverage increases. In addition, we were unable to test for differences in perceived barriers to  vaccination between s and s because of the small sample size. However, this was the first study to examine this question and will inform future studies in larger samples that can test this comparison. The measures (ie, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and perceived parental hesitancy) adopted from previous studies were unvalidated at the time of study; however, we found them to have acceptable reliability. We included all of the demographic variables from the survey as covariates except for years of experience of the providers because of its strong correlation with age; we were unable to account for other potential unmeasured confounders. Given that the data were self-reported, there was potential for social desirability and recall bias. Finally, because this study only surveyed providers and not parents, we could not assess how well the perceived reasons of the providers aligned with actual reasons for hesitancy of the parents. This study points to the need for future research to do so. Provider perceptions of parental barriers to  vaccine hesitancy are an important factor contributing to  vaccine uptake among parents []. Strategies are needed to effectively reduce provider-perceived barriers to parental  vaccine hesitancy and to assist providers in addressing these barriers in patient-provider communication. Our results suggest intervention targets to improve provider perceptions of parental barriers by addressing specific factors that may influence their perceptions. Particularly, intervention developers should consider addressing providers&#x2019; self-efficacy, perceived outcome expectations, and confidence in  vaccine safety. Ultimately, addressing these provider-level factors may improve recommendation practices and communication strategies among providers for addressing hesitancy, to increase  vaccination rates among children of  vaccine hesitant parents.

It is necessary to identify novel and effective biomarkers or risk signatures for  patients.  Differentially expressed genes (s) between  and low-grade glioma () in A samples were screened out and weight correlation network analysis () was performed to confirm  grade-related genes. Five genes were selected via multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and were used to construct a risk signature. A nomogram composed of the risk signature and clinical characters (age, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy experience) was established to predict 1, 3, 5-year survival rate for  patients.  One hundred ninety-four s in blue gene module were found to be positively related to  grade via  Five genes (, 17, C5A, C11, ) were selected to construct a risk signature for  via R language. This risk signature was identified to independently predict the outcome of  patients, as well as stratified by 1 status, T promoter status, and radio-chemotherapy. The nomogram was established which combined the risk signature with clinical factors. The results of c-index,  curve and calibration plot revealed the nomogram showing a good accuracy for predicting 1, 3, or 5-year survival of  patients.  The risk signature with five genes could serve as an independent factor for predicting the prognosis of patients with . Moreover, the nomogram with the risk signature and clinical traits proved to perform better for predicting 1, 3, 5-year survival rate. Glioblastoma () is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor in adult. Despite comprehensive regimens including maximum surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis of  is notoriously poor, with a median survival of 14 months and the 5-year survival rate remaining at ~5% (). Therefore, it becomes particularly important to search for novel molecular biomarkers that precisely predict the prognosis and to choose appropriate individualized treatment strategies for patients with . With the progress of genetics and molecular biology, an increasing number of molecular biomarkers were discovered in glioma, for instance,  mutation, T methylation, T promoter mutation, R and P53 (). In this study, we developed a risk signature with five genes associated with survival of  patients. On this basis, a nomogram including the risk signature and clinical factors was established and it proved to be effective in predicting the clinical outcome of patients with . Gene expression and survival data of glioma in A were downloaded from GlioVis (). six hundred twenty samples from A  (-seq) were selected for screening differentially expressed genes between  and low-grade glioma (). Five hundred twenty-five samples from A  (-133A) were used to construct a clinical survival prediction model and internal validation. Based on 470 lower grade glioma (, World Health Organization [] grade  and ) ((fold-change)|&gt; 1 and false discovery rate () &lt; 0.05 were considered as s for further analysis. To select glioma grade-related genes from s, we performed weight correlation network analysis () (). The minimum gene size in each module was set as 10. The module eigengenes were calculated and similar modules were clustered and merged according to the module dissection threshold. The correlations between gene modules and clinical traits were calculated and visualized through a heatmap. In this research, we chose the module which is positively related to  grade for further study. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was applied to assess the relationship between the expression of s and the overall survival () of patients with  in A  (-seq) and -133A platform, respectively. Common genes with ), as follows: The patients were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups according to the median risk score value.  survival analysis and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic () curve analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic value. s between low-risk and high-risk groups with  &lt;0.05 were filtered by R language (edgeR package) and used for Gene ontology () and G pathway analysis via  website ().

Identification of  grade-related genes in glioma.  Heatmap exhibited the relationships between gene modules and clinical traits by Pearson correlation. To identify genes associated with clinical traits, we collected the -seq data of s and clinical information ( grade, age, gender,  status, survival time and status), and performed  analysis. Firstly, the samples were clustered and basic clinical traits were displayed ( = 0.56). Therefore, genes in the blue module were used for further study. To select prognosis related genes, we performed univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to analyze the genes in blue module in A  (-seq) and -133A platforms. Seventeen overlapped genes significantly correlated with overall survival (). Characteristics of the risk signature with five genes.

To further explore its clinical application, we investigated the relationship between the risk score and glioma subtype, 1 and T promoter status, respectively. The mesenchymal subtype inclined to have higher risk scores than neural and proneural subtype (), though the average risk scores between the two groups didn't differ largely. Expression and prognostic significance of the risk signature in different cohorts. Association between the risk signature and different cohorts stratified by molecular subtype . The relationships between the risk score and patient prognosis stratified by 1, T promoter status were also explored. There was no significant statistical difference between high-risk group and low-risk group in  patients with 1 mutant (). These results revealed that the risk signature could serve as an independent factor for predicting the prognosis of patients with . To further investigate the functional roles and G pathways associated with the risk signature, we first screened out the s between the high-risk group and low-risk group. Ninety-five genes with  &lt;0.05 were selected for  and G pathway analysis via  (). Biological functions and G pathways related to the risk signature with five genes.  A was performed to confirm the  term (extracellular structure organization) and G pathways ( receptor interaction and focal adhesion). Since the risk signature had a better performance in predicting the prognosis of  patients, we explored its clinical significance combining with clinical characters (age, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy experience). Firstly, the samples in the A -133A platform were divided into training cohort (364 cases) and validation cohort (155 cases) randomly (). These results above revealed that the nomogram demonstrated a good accuracy for predicting 1, 3, or 5-year survival of  patients.

So far,  is still a lethal disease without efficient therapeutic regimens. The failure to develop new treatments ascribes to a lack of validation of novel molecular targets, which are often performed in animal models and directly translated to human trials (), indicating the essential value of our signature. Nomograms have been applied extensively and exhibit favorable effects on predicting clinical risk signatures and outcomes in some cancers (), and confirmed genes associated with glioma grade, which is an clinical indicator directly associated with the prognosis of glioma patients. Secondly, the risk signature with five genes was proven to be an independent prognostic biomarker in  via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox regression analysis. In addition, on the basis of the risk signature and other clinical factors (age, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy experience), the nomogram can predict the 1, 3, 5-year survival rate precisely, thus providing evidences of treatment for  patients.

Unfortunately, salvage options remain limited. In this study, we assessed outcomes for patients with recurrent gliomas treated with reirradiation. We retrospectively identified 48 glioma patients treated with reirradiation between 2013 and 2016. All had radiographic or pathologic evidence of recurrence. Prognostic factors were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Initial surgery included biopsy in 15, subtotal resection in 21, and gross total resection in 12. Initial chemotherapy included temozolomide () in 31, +dasatinib in 7, +vorinostat in 3, and procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine in 2. The median dose of primary radiotherapy was 60 Gy delivered in 30 fractions. Median overall survival () and progression-free survival () from initial diagnosis were 3.2 and 1.7 years, respectively. A total of 36 patients failed salvage bevacizumab before reirradiation. Salvage surgery was performed before reirradiation in 21 patients. Median time to reirradiation was 1.7 years. Median follow-up was 13.7 months from reirradiation. Concurrent systemic therapy was given in 33 patients (bevacizumab in 27,  in 8, and lomustine in 2). Median  and  after reirradiation were 3.2 and 6.3 months, respectively. Radionecrosis occurred in 4 patients and no radionecrosis was seen in patients receiving concurrent bevacizumab with reirradiation (0% vs 19%,  = .03).

Relatively little is known about vaccine hesitancy in Switzerland. This ongoing study (2017&#x2013;2021) focuses on biomedical and complementary and alternative medicine () providers and their patients since healthcare professionals play important roles in vaccination decision-making. This national research programme seeks to assess the sociocultural determinants of vaccine hesitancy regarding childhood and human papillomavirus vaccines in Switzerland. We aim to provide a detailed characterisation of vaccine hesitancy, including  and biomedical perspectives, patient&#x2013;provider interactions, and sociocultural factors, to establish the mediating effects of vaccine hesitancy on underimmunisation, and to design an intervention to improve vaccination communication and counselling among physicians, parents and adolescents. Our transdisciplinary team employs a sequential exploratory mixed-methods study design. We have established a network of more than 150 medical providers across Switzerland, including more than 40  practitioners. For the qualitative component, we conduct interviews with parents, youth, and biomedical and  providers and observations of vaccination consultations and school vaccination information sessions. For the quantitative component, a sample of 1350 parents of young children and 722 young adults (15&#x2013;26 years) and their medical providers respond to questionnaires. We measure vaccine hesitancy with the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines 15-item survey and review vaccination certificates to assess vaccination status. We administer additional questions based on findings from qualitative research, addressing communication with medical providers, vaccine information sources and perceptions of risk control vis-&#xE0;-vis vaccine-preventable diseases. The questionnaires capture sociodemographics, political views, religion and spirituality, and moral foundations. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated to healthcare professionals, researchers and the public via conferences and public presentations. A novelty of this research includes its large sample of complementary and alternative medicine () and biomedical providers, with consideration given to their vaccination perspectives and interactions with their patients. The study emphasis on  providers is important since previous studies have shown an association between  use and vaccine hesitancy as well as high patient demand for  in Switzerland. The sequential exploratory mixed-method study design and transdisciplinary nature of this study provide further insights into the relationships between  and biomedical providers and vaccine hesitancy and uptake, with the qualitative methods and results having informed the design of the quantitative questionnaire. Although the methodological approach to recruit patients via medical providers is advantageous because it allows for the examination of effects of provider characteristics on patient vaccination beliefs and behaviours, it limits our results because populations that do not regularly see medical providers are under-represented in our data. Furthermore, the data do not provide nationally representative results. When vaccine hesitancy leads to , towards certain potentially dangerous infectious agents and increases the risk of disease outbreaks. In Switzerland, childhood vaccinations are usually given by private practitioners, predominantly paediatricians and general internists. There is no national mandate for vaccination in non-epidemic settings in Switzerland and no national vaccination registry. Despite this, vaccination coverage in Switzerland is high overall.) Both basic and complementary vaccines are reimbursed by basic mandatory health insurance when the official vaccination schedule is respected. Cantonal coverage levels for  vaccination range from 79% (Valais) to 19% (Appenzell Innerrhoden) for two doses of  vaccine.  coverage estimates only include 16-year-old girls and estimates for boys are not yet available. This suggests further research is needed to better understand vaccine hesitancy and school-based vaccination programmes in Switzerland. Vaccine hesitancy and underimmunisation seem to be specific to certain population subgroups. This relationship merits further investigation and discussion. To explore vaccine hesitancy and provide a detailed characterisation of its health system, patient&#x2013;provider interaction, health communication, information sources, decision-making process, and demographic, geographical and sociocultural correlates in Switzerland. To assess the sociocultural and health system determinants of vaccine hesitancy and underimmunisation with childhood and  vaccines in Switzerland. This objective additionally aims at establishing the mediating effects of vaccine hesitancy on underimmunisation. To use the knowledge gained as the necessary background to design and submit a pilot intervention and to design tailored interventions to address vaccine hesitancy in Switzerland. Our research takes place in the setting of an ongoing Swiss national research programme (National Research Programme 74). The study protocol underwent successful peer review.

The project applies mixed methods through the use of a . We recruit participants from the three major language regions of Switzerland (German-speaking, French-speaking and Italian-speaking) in order to examine vaccination decision-making throughout the country. Study overview. , complementary and alternative medicine; , human papillomavirus. The qualitative and quantitative phases of the project both involve recruitment in medical providers&#x2019; offices and interviewers with medical providers. For this purpose, we established a network of participating providers via the H&#x2019;s Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network and through direct recruitment by our research team. Our research team and advisory board include both  and biomedical providers, who have helped recruit their colleagues for this project, sharing recruitment documents (ie, invitation letters and study flyers), making telephone calls and employing snowball sampling. Ongoing provider recruitment efforts have enabled us to develop a network of over 150  and biomedical providers from 21 of the 26 cantons and all three language regions in Switzerland. For the study&#x2019;s qualitative component, we conduct semistructured, indepth interviews with parents, youth, and biomedical physicians and  providers. We also observe vaccination consultations with parents and providers and  information events in schools. For the study&#x2019;s quantitative component, we recruit participants from the practices of the network of  and biomedical providers across Switzerland and perform quantitative telephone interviews with parents of children 0&#x2013;11 years of age and youth aged 15&#x2013;26 years. We also interview the participating providers. The collection of information about vaccine hesitancy from providers and their patients allows for a comparison of their perceptions of vaccinations. Some providers participate in both the qualitative and quantitative research components, while most participate only in the quantitative phase. Importantly, our team had already established trusting relationships with a number of  physicians by the time of grant submission. These contacts have been crucial in expanding our network of  providers in Switzerland for the quantitative study phase. The qualitative methods of this research allow us to gain deeper insight into parent and youth vaccination decision-making and patient&#x2013;provider interactions about vaccination in general practice settings. The qualitative methods additionally further our understanding about public health gaps in vaccination implementation programmes in Switzerland by paying attention to how participants discuss the Swiss health system in relation to vaccination. Finally, the qualitative methods inform the design of the quantitative study component tools. The transdisciplinary research team drafted interview guides and medical consultation observation guides to be used as qualitative study tools. The interview guides were written based on relevant vaccine hesitancy literature and guide researchers through semistructured interviews with participants through the use of open-ended questions. Semistructured interviews involve researchers asking the same questions systematically to all participants, but allow the option for researchers to probe further by asking additional questions about themes emerging during the interview. The medical consultation observation guides allow researchers to systematically focus on items of interest highlighted in vaccine hesitancy literature on patient&#x2013;provider interactions. Both the interview guides and the observation guides were piloted for coherence and clarity. An important concept in qualitative research to determine sample sizes is the concept of saturation, which indicates that similar results are consistently collected during data collection and adequately address the research questions at hand. When saturation has been attained in qualitative research, researchers can reasonably expect similar results if the research process were to continue. We expect to reach data saturation with the number of qualitative face-to-face interviews and observations mentioned below, but the qualitative nature of this approach allows us flexibility in adjusting the amount of data to be collected. We conduct indepth, semistructured qualitative interviews with at least 15  providers and at least 15 biomedical physicians in providers&#x2019; offices. Interview questions are organised by theme, including (1) contextual information about the providers (ie, type of training, type of medicine practised, years of clinical experience and descriptions of the types of patients they treat); (2) questions about interactions with their patients and typical vaccination consultations (ie, amount of time spent discussing vaccination, communication strategies and perceptions about communication training); and (3) views and perspectives on medicine, immunity and the body (ie, information sources on vaccinations, perceptions about their advantages and disadvantages, &#x2018;natural acquired immunity&#x2019; vs vaccine-acquired immunity, public health benefits compared with individual choice considerations, and vaccination rates and public health approaches in Switzerland). The interviews are audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. If participants request transcriptions, we provide them so that they may clarify anything that they discussed. We observe a total of 30 vaccination consultations (15 with  providers, 15 with biomedical providers) with 10 different providers (5 , 5 biomedical). We ask willing providers to allow us to observe consultations during which they discuss vaccination with parents for the first time. Prior to consultation observations, researchers discuss how they are conducted, with both providers and patients having the option to not be observed. In cases of reluctance to participate, potential participants are able to ask questions about the study, and researchers provide them with written information about the study. We do not observe participants who do not wish to participate in the study. To date, providers not wishing to be observed are uncommon, and no patients have refused being observed. Providers explained these rare refusals by describing how they did not wish researchers&#x2019; observations to disturb the natural flow of consultations with patients, not having enough time or not seeing enough patients with whom they discuss vaccination for the first time on a daily basis. Researchers take ethnographic field notes about the observation in field journals in order to document what happens during the interactions. They then fill out a medical consultation observation guide, which prompts them to record information about patients and providers, the reason for the consultation, who initiated the vaccination discussion, if vaccinations were discussed in a participatory or presumptive manner, questions asked by patients, if and how patients expressed hesitancy towards vaccination, researchers&#x2019; perceptions of the patients&#x2019; ability to understand the vaccination discussion, the vaccination decision, the amount of time spent discussing vaccination, information source materials, and the researchers&#x2019; perceptions of the mood, emotions and communication between parents and providers. After observing the medical consultations, researchers use ethnographic field notes and the observation guide as the basis to write observations into a descriptive narrative format of each observed consultation. We conduct indepth qualitative interviews with 30 vaccine-hesitant parents and 10 parents who vaccinate according to the H vaccination schedule. Interviews are conducted in their homes or in a place of their choosing, such as a coffee shop. We purposefully sample more vaccine-hesitant parents, particularly those who consult  providers for their children, since an important study assumption is that vaccine hesitancy, underimmunisation by parents and their usage of  are codetermined. We ask parents questions thematically about (1) family composition and parental roles (ie, work, childcare, child healthcare decisions); (2) children&#x2019;s health, healthcare and lifestyle (ie, types of healthcare professionals parents consult for their children, health beliefs and practices,  use, preventive practices, and so on); (3) immunisation status of the children with the support of vaccination booklets during the interview; (4) vaccination perspectives (views on individualised vaccination calendars and views on the public health benefits or consequences of vaccination); and (5) vaccination experiences (the vaccination decision-making process, vaccination discussions with healthcare professionals and others, and perceptions of social pressure to vaccinate or not vaccinate). There are limited published data on adolescent female views on  vaccine and no data on adolescent male views on  vaccine in Switzerland. Therefore, we also conduct qualitative indepth interviews with approximately 40 youth (approximately 25 males and 15 females) recruited through the  quantitative research discussed below. Interviews take place in participants&#x2019; homes or in a place of their choosing, such as a coffee shop. We purposively sample more male youth since there is no literature on male perspectives on  in Switzerland, and  vaccination recommendations are more recent for males than females. If youth provide their consent, the parents of 15 youth are interviewed separately and in family focus group discussions () together with the youth. Themes of the interviews and  include (1) questions relating to family composition and parental roles; (2) youth health, healthcare and lifestyle (ie, types of healthcare, professionals young adults/adolescents consult, health beliefs and practices,  use, preventive practices, and so on); (3)  immunisation status; (4)  perspectives; and (5)  vaccination experiences and the vaccination decision-making process. This last theme focuses particularly on discussions with parents, friends, acquaintances, significant others, potential sexual partners, information sources, schools&#x2019; roles in providing vaccination information, and how or if the youth ever felt any social pressure to vaccinate or not vaccinate against . We observe 10 school information activities about  vaccines in three to four cantons. We choose cantons based on convenience in terms of access and ethical clearance to conduct ethnographic observations for research purposes. Researchers attend school-based events during which the  vaccination is presented to youth. In classrooms, our researchers explain to students and instructors that we are there to observe and take notes on the content of the discussions as part of a study that examines how this type of information is communicated in schools. No identifying information is documented or included in any dissemination of research results. Observation notes are documented in field journals and subsequently written into a descriptive narrative format. We purposively sample an estimated two to three public health officials from the H, two to three cantonal authorities, and approximately five school physicians for expert interviews (n=10&#x2013;15) in order to gain further information about how recommendations are made, discussed, planned and implemented from a public health perspective. Interviews focus on perceptions of the implementation of vaccination programmes from public health authority perspectives and are informed by specific questions from our qualitative enquiries. In order to better understand how information sources affect parent, youth and provider decision-making processes, we document and analyse sources of information that they discuss during the qualitative and quantitative interviews and medical consultation observations using both thematic analysis we are particularly interested in parents&#x2019; and youth&#x2019;s use of and interactions with internet sources. The following are the primary research questions guiding the conduct of the qualitative research: (1) How do parents and youth make vaccination decisions? (2) How do medical providers, both  and biomedical, consider what vaccination recommendations to make to their patients? (3) How do medical providers discuss vaccination with parents and youth? (4) How are vaccination implementation programmes envisaged from a public health perspective? We use the Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research checklist and to code data into relevant research themes while still being open to including categories and themes that emerge through qualitative data collection and analysis. Data are coded primarily by the interviewers, with coded segments being discussed with various members of the research team. Sensitising concepts are used in qualitative research in order to guide researchers to selectively focus on emerging themes and categories relevant to the research questions; for this research, sensitising concepts include patient&#x2013;provider interactions, provider and patient interaction with information sources, health beliefs and practices, and interactions with and perceptions of the Swiss health system. The quantitative phase of our study seeks to explore and quantify the determinants of vaccine hesitancy and underimmunisation with childhood and  vaccines in Switzerland. To this end, we developed questionnaires targeted at the different populations included in our study. As childhood and  vaccinations involve different populations and are generally viewed differently by patients, we survey two separate populations: parents of young children and youth (and their parents, if possible). In addition, we survey providers to gain a better understanding of views on vaccination in our diverse network of participating providers and the relationship between provider and patient views on vaccination. To fully explore vaccine hesitancy and underimmunisation in these diverse populations, we developed four separate questionnaires: (1) a childhood vaccination questionnaire to be administered to parents of young children; (2) an  vaccination survey for youth; (3) an  vaccination survey for parents; and (4) a questionnaire for providers. As Switzerland is a multilingual country, we developed versions of the questionnaire in the three main national languages, German, French and Italian. In addition, given the large number of immigrants living in Switzerland, we developed an English version of the questionnaire for those who preferred doing the interview in English. As vaccine hesitancy is often correlated with political beliefs we also include a series of questions on political and religious beliefs and practices drawn from the  2014. We include three questions on each theme. For religion, we ask about interviewees&#x2019; religious affiliation, the frequency with which they attend religious services and their perceptions of their own religiosity. For political beliefs, we ask about interviewees&#x2019; level of interest in politics, which political party they feel close to and where they place themselves of a left-right political scale. In addition, all questionnaires include the 20-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire showing that moral foundations are associated with vaccine hesitancy. These survey items were all already extensively published and available in our survey languages and did not require translation or validation. Based on preliminary findings in the qualitative phase, we developed new questions around several themes, including (1) communication about vaccination with medical providers; (2) information sources consulted in vaccination decision-making; (3) perceptions about risk and control concerning possible exposure to vaccine-preventable diseases; and (4) the parent&#x2013;provider relationship. For the  vaccination surveys, we also developed questions specific to this vaccine and its administration in Switzerland, including questions on knowledge of  vaccine, sources of  vaccination and perceptions of school-based vaccination programmes. In addition, we ask both parents and youth a series of questions about health, including questions about health status,  usage and medical care usage. The provider questionnaire also asks for details about providers&#x2019; practices, particularly with regard to their practice of . The questions we developed that are based on preliminary findings from the qualitative phase are listed in online supplementary . French, German and Italian versions of the V15 were not available, so these questions and the new questions developed for these questionnaires were translated into French, German and Italian. Thirty-three key questions including the V and questions developed based on preliminary results of the qualitative portion of the study were translated using the forward and backward method. Two independent translators first translated into the target language (German, French or Italian) and then reconciled any disparities in their translations. Next, two different, independent translators who were blinded to the original questions translated them back into English. Once developed, we pretested and piloted the childhood vaccination and  versions of our questionnaires in all languages. For the pretest, we recruited a convenience sample of 61 individuals to test the questionnaires in all four survey languages. We pretested each version of the questionnaire with two to seven people and adjusted based on feedback. We then piloted the adjusted questionnaires using our full recruitment procedure (see &#x2018;Recruitment and survey populations&#x2019;), conducting a further 56 interviews with the three questionnaires in the four survey languages. Finally, we pretested the provider questionnaire among providers in German, French and Italian. The questionnaire was also shared with the project&#x2019;s advisory board and adjusted based on their feedback. A conservative estimate is a proportion of 15% vaccine-hesitant parents in the practices of the participating biomedical and  providers combined (: 7% unvaccinated and 12% children with delayed vaccination were recorded in the 2012 H survey). The sample size calculation aims at identifying the number of participants needed to detect a significant association of specific individual risk factors with vaccine hesitancy, which is here considered as a binary outcome. We further assume that factors potentially associated with vaccine hesitancy are prevalent in 20% of the population and that the  between vaccine hesitancy and a relevant risk factor is at least 2. In this case, to detect a statistically significant association with such a risk factor at the level of 0.05 with a power of 0.8, 675 participants are needed. Due to the recruitment in selected provider practices, a certain clustering of parents&#x2019; characteristics is to be expected for parents recruited in the same practice, in contrast to a simple random sample. To account for such clustering, a design effect of 2 is conservatively assumed, leading to a total sample of 1350 parents to be interviewed. This would equally allow detecting a 10% lower proportion of vaccination among parents who are vaccine-hesitant compared with a vaccination rate of 90% in the remaining population. To investigate vaccine hesitancy and associations with underimmunisation in the case of  vaccination, a separate sample of participants is required. Similar to the first case, we might also assume 15% vaccine-hesitant participants, and we further anticipate a 30% lower rate of vaccination among vaccine-hesitant persons than in the entire population. With a given prevalence of  vaccination of 53%, this would mean that among vaccine-hesitant persons only 37% would be vaccinated. With power=0.8&#x2009;and alpha=0.05,&#x2009;a sample of 593 participants would be needed. To account for clustering, assuming a design effect of 2, the final sample would include 1186 participants. However, more likely is a higher vaccine hesitancy rate of 30%, given the relative novelty of  vaccines and the fact that it has been recommended in boys/adolescents only for the past 3 years. With power=0.8&#x2009;and alpha=0.05,&#x2009;a sample of 361 participants would be needed. To account for the cluster sample, assuming a design effect of 2, the final sample would include 722 participants. Based on the above power analyses, our study populations include 1350 parents of children aged 0&#x2013;11 for the childhood vaccination study and 722 young people aged 15&#x2013;21 years (for young women) or 15&#x2013;26 years (for young men) for the  vaccination study. As mentioned, there is regional and linguistic variation regarding . Moreover, conditional on this assumption being correct, the statistical power to detect an association between vaccine hesitancy and the likelihood of obtaining  vaccination would not be sizably smaller in the presence of geographical or language heterogeneity in  vaccination rates than without such heterogeneity. We recruit our participants through the offices of the network of  and biomedical providers. As  shows, our provider network includes more than 150  and biomedical providers working in all three language regions in Switzerland and in almost every canton. Each dot represents a practice participating in the study: red dots represent  practitioners and blue dots biomedical providers. To ensure confidentiality, we place dots in the correct canton but do not place them at the exact provider location. Group practices are represented by a single dot. Network of participating providers. , complementary and alternative medicine. Providers are  or biomedical providers who treat children and/or youth and regularly deal with questions regarding vaccinations and vaccine decisions. They include paediatricians, general practitioners, gynaecologists,  physicians and  providers without formal medical training working independently or in group practices. We interview parents and young people by telephone. Each telephone interview lasts approximately 30&#x2013;35&#x2009;min. Parents are recruited from urban and rural medical practices in French-speaking, German-speaking and Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland. In addition, we interview each participating provider in order to examine the relationships between provider perspectives, patient perspectives and vaccine hesitancy. For the  portion of our study, we nterview one of the participating youth&#x2019;s parents if the youth allow us to do so. To be eligible to participate in the study, participants fulfil the following criteria. For the childhood vaccination substudy, parents are 18 years old or older with a child aged 0&#x2013;11. For the quantitative  portion of our study, young women are between the ages of 15 and 21 (born between 1 July 1997 and 1 July 2003) and young men are between the ages of 15 and 26 (born between 1 July 1992 and 1 July 2003). These differences are due to the timing of  vaccine recommendations for girls and boys.  vaccine reimbursement for girls 11&#x2013;14 (target age) and 15&#x2013;19 (catch-up age) started 1 January 2008.  vaccination reimbursement for males began on 1 July 2016 in Switzerland. Given the newness of this recommendation, we enrol youth males born between 1 July 1992 and 1 July 2003 in order to gather data on all males aged 15&#x2013;26 who have been eligible for the  vaccine through Swiss vaccine programmes. All study participants (parents, youth and providers) must speak one of the main Swiss national languages (French, German or Italian) or English. We recruit all parents and youth through providers in order to be able to link the data from the parents with their provider&#x2019;s data for a comparison by type of provider. We use a quota sampling technique as  providers are likely to see fewer patients per day. Our goal is to recruit a maximum of 20 parents of young children and a maximum of 15 youth per provider based on a rigorous sampling approach in a defined period. Recruitment targets for group practices are no more than three times the target for individual providers. Thus, targets in dual practices are 40 parents and 30 youth, and for practices with three or more providers, targets are 60 parents and 45 youth. For every practice, the total number of eligible patients in a specific time period will be established, which allows post-hoc weighting to the known total of eligible patients in this time period. Given the diversity of providers and differences in our study subpopulations, we employ a variety of recruitment techniques. In large practices or practices with high patient volume, interviewers recruit participants directly in providers&#x2019; waiting rooms. Interviewers are medical students trained in recruiting participants, obtaining informed consent, conducting quantitative interviews over the telephone and quantitative data management. For inoffice recruitment, interviewers spend 2&#x2013;5 days in providers&#x2019; waiting rooms, with the goal of recruiting a maximum of 20 parents and/or a maximum of 15 youth for interviews. Interviewers contact all eligible patients to present the study and ask whether they are interested in participating. For those who agree, interviewers obtain informed consent and a copy of the vaccination certificate (if possible) in waiting rooms and then arrange to conduct a telephone interview at a later time. In large group practices, interviewers have the option to work as a team to manage particularly high patient volumes. In smaller practices or practices with lower patient volumes for the targeted groups, we ask providers to recruit participants retrospectively by reviewing their patient log from the last 2&#x2013;6 months and contacting eligible patients to see if they would be interested in participating in the study. Providers transmit a detailed record of attempted contacts and take note of refusals and interested parties. We then contact those who indicate an interest by phone to present the study, obtain informed consent and a copy of the vaccination certificate (if possible), and arrange for a telephone interview. Interviewers select potential participants randomly from the lists provided until they have the required quota of participants in each group. Interviewers determine the most appropriate recruitment technique during a first visit with the provider. As some providers may have high volumes of one population and low volumes of another (eg, paediatricians may see many young children but few youths 15 of age or over), we may employ different recruitment methods for the different subsamples. Experience to date shows that providers generally accept our preferred recruitment practice for their type of practice. However, we work with providers to find workable solutions if they are uncomfortable with or unable to accommodate our standard recruitment procedures. Although small practices, particularly for  providers, are often hesitant to let interviewers recruit in waiting rooms, such practices rarely have sufficient patient volume to merit that approach. Very few large-volume providers have been unwilling to allow interviewers to recruit in waiting rooms; however, when they are, we implement the provider recruitment practice used in smaller practices. More commonly, practices do not have the capacity to review patient logs and contact patients. In that case, as approved by the local ethics commissions, interviewers can assist medical providers and their assistance in reviewing logs and contacting patients from providers&#x2019; offices. For all recruitment techniques, we track how many people were contacted, how many agreed to participate or be contacted again, how many gave consent to interviews, and how many completed interviews. This information will allow us to assess the refusal rate, the dropout rate and the number of individuals lost to follow up. Additionally, we conduct a quantitative telephone or face-to-face survey with all participating providers during the quantitative component of the study in order to quantitatively assess if providers&#x2019; vaccine perspectives are associated with those of their patients. The following are our primary quantitative research questions: What are the determinants of vaccine hesitancy for childhood and  vaccinations in Switzerland? What is the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and underimmunisation? We measure vaccine hesitancy based on the V score. As this instrument has not previously been used in Switzerland or in our survey languages, we first test its validity for Switzerland using Mokken Scale analysis to confirm the unidimensionality of the scale. Individuals with a V score of &#x2265;50 are considered vaccine-hesitant, and individuals with a V score &lt;50 are not considered vaccine-hesitant. We will use multilevel logistic regression to assess the influence of different variables on vaccine hesitancy. We will explore associations between vaccine hesitancy and a number of individual-level characteristics, including age, sex, household composition, place of birth, immigration status, household income, employment status and work hours, daycare usage, highest achieved level of education, political affiliations, religion,  usage, trust in medical providers and satisfaction with consultations, sources of information about vaccination consulted, views on parents&#x2019; role in vaccine decisions, views of importance of health, views of risks of vaccine-preventable diseases, and moral foundations. In addition, our research design allows us to explore how factors at higher levels are associated with vaccine hesitancy, including how vaccine hesitancy varies by canton and language region and by provider or by various provider characteristics ( vs biomedical providers), and to what extent vaccine hesitancy of the parent/youth correlates with vaccine hesitancy of the provider. Finally, although our data are not representative, we can weight results to allow us to roughly estimate the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Switzerland. This study is ongoing, with some parts of the research completed, others ongoing and others yet to begin. For the qualitative portion of the study, we have completed qualitative interviews with biomedical and  providers and ethnographic observations of vaccination consultations. We have also completed qualitative interviews with parents of young children. Qualitative interviews with youth and parents focusing on  vaccination are ongoing. We are at the recruitment stage for our qualitative research on  vaccination at schools and with public health officials. Finally, we are compiling a list of vaccination information sources based on responses to questions related to this subject in the quantitative questionnaires and discussions in qualitative interviews with parents and youth. We will begin analysis once this list in complete, at the end of data collection for qualitative interviews and the questionnaires. For the quantitative portion of our study, we have completed questionnaire design and testing and the power analysis to determine sample size. We are currently recruiting and interviewing parents, youth and providers for the survey, with approximately half of interviews completed. We continue to recruit providers as well. By using a sequential exploratory mixed-methods study design, this study will provide rich and multifaceted data on vaccination decision-making and vaccine hesitancy in Switzerland. In line with such a study design, the qualitative data informed the tools used for the quantitative data collection component. The results of both qualitative and quantitative components of our study will likely be complementary to one another and will allow us to answer different types of research questions. That said, any discrepancies or contradictory findings between the qualitative and quantitative components will merit further investigation, which we will highlight in the dissemination of study results. Additionally, given the multifaceted nature of vaccine hesitancy and health decision-making and the study&#x2019;s exploratory mixed-methods study design, the results from both qualitative and quantitative components will provide us with rich and detailed data for the Swiss context, where there is limited available data. A particular strength of this study is its focus on perspectives of both medical providers and their patients. Studies have shown that providers remain a trusted source of information for parents and youth facing vaccine decisions, so a greater understanding of provider perspectives is important. few studies include the perspective of  providers and none that we know of has the extent of cooperation with  providers found here. Qualitative interviews provide key insights into parents, youths, and  and biomedical providers&#x2019; perspectives on vaccination. In addition, interviews with  and biomedical providers shed light onto their views on vaccination, vaccine-hesitant patients and how they interact with this population in their practices. Observations of vaccine consultations in offices provide another opportunity to get a sense of the variety of approaches providers employ when broaching the subject of vaccination. The combination of qualitative interviews with numerous stakeholders in vaccine decision-making and planning, ethnographic observations of vaccination consultations and school information sessions about the  vaccination, and qualitative analysis of vaccination information sources allows for qualitative triangulation into the multifaceted phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy in Switzerland. Such a triangulation of qualitative data through multiple qualitative methods allows us to better understand the &#x2018;multiple realities&#x2019; of medical consultations, in addition to allowing us to explore how various actors interact with and perceive the Swiss health system in regard to vaccination. Although data are not strictly representative of Switzerland, data from the quantitative survey gives us a sense of the overall prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Switzerland and how this varies between language regions, cantons, and urban, suburban and rural settings. More importantly, it allows us to explore the association of vaccine hesitancy with other factors, like  usage, religion and spirituality, moral foundations, and political orientation. In addition, by pairing data from providers and their patients, we can see whether there is an association between providers&#x2019; and patients&#x2019; views on vaccines. The quantitative data also provides us with insight into the major sources of information parents and youth draw on when making vaccination decisions. Finally, the mixed-methods study design allowing for the qualitative component to inform the quantitative component also allows us to triangulate both the qualitative and quantitative data gathered throughout the duration of the study so that results from both components can be compared. There are several limitations to the various parts of our study. A major limitation, which we also argue should be seen as a study strength, comes from our focus on recruiting participants through providers. This technique has major advantages when seeking to examine effects of provider characteristics on patient beliefs and behaviours, particularly for a topic such as vaccine hesitancy where trust between patients and providers has been shown to be a major determinant. These questions also allow us to assess if disagreements between patients and providers have brought patients to seek care elsewhere in more provider-driven selection processes. The quantitative component recruitment strategy indicates that populations that do not regularly see medical providers are under-represented in our data. While universal health insurance requirements attempt to ensure that most people living in Switzerland have access to healthcare, certain populations are still under-represented, including recent migrants and undocumented populations. Recruiting through providers poses further questions of selection bias, as people who see doctors more often are more likely to participate in our study. This bias means that, for example, parents of infants were more apt to be recruited than parents of older children, as infants see the doctor more regularly. Selection bias problems are particularly relevant to youth populations, as most youth are healthy and thus among the least likely to regularly seek medical care. As such, youth in our study may differ in important ways from youth in Switzerland overall. In addition, as our provider network was established through personal recruitment by members of the study team and snowball sampling, the network itself is not representative and subject to selection bias. In our view, the advantages of being able to link provider and patient data outweighed these limitations. For qualitative interviewing, interviewer effects may affect the type and quality of information we received; interviews and observations are conducted by a male medical sociologist trained in qualitative research methods, a female medical doctor trained in qualitative research methods, a female senior medical student with qualitative research training, and a female medical anthropologist trained in qualitative research methods. That being said, having a variety of researchers with different backgrounds involved in the data collection and analytical process adds to the richness of the analysis through clarification of concepts during indepth research team discussions. Another limitation arises from the way we observed vaccine discussions. Observers watch the discussion in person and take notes, but do not audio-record or video-record discussions. The absence of such recordings limits our ability to rigorously analyse the conversations, while the physical presence of observers in the consultation may have had an effect on discussions. Furthermore, given that the data are collected in both French-speaking and German-speaking regions of Switzerland, we have a multilingual corpus which necessitates indepth discussions between study members during qualitative data analysis. Furthermore, as noted above, the quantitative study is not based on a representative sample but instead allowsusto compare results between different types of providers and their patients, and between different sociocultural regions of Switzerland. As in the qualitative component, interviewer effects may affect the type and quality of information we received. We will include data quality controls into data analysis in order to check for interviewer effects. Additionally, linguistic barriers, particularly with recent migrants to Switzerland, may prove challenging for participants to provide accurate responses to our interview questions. Vaccine hesitancy is a complex public health issue in high-income countries, yet there is no agreed-on measure of vaccine hesitancy. Multilingual, validated instruments for measuring vaccine hesitancy are rare, making comparative study difficult. This study develops and test translations of the 15-item V in three new languages and provides valuable assessments of vaccine hesitancy in French-speaking, German-speaking and Italian-speaking contexts. Furthermore, our study design includes vaccination certificates in order to statistically examine the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and underimmunisation. Results from the study make a contribution to the literature on the relationship between  usage and vaccine hesitancy. The combination of rich qualitative data including both biomedical and  perspectives and provider-linked data from patients who see  practitioners allows for a more indepth examination of this relationship than found in the literature to date. A combination of the data collected through the quantitative and qualitative methods and their analysis will form the necessary background for the design, submission and implementation of an appropriate randomised control trial intervention designed at improving vaccine communication and counselling among physicians, parents and adolescents in Switzerland. Study participants, both patients and medical providers, are involved in the study design throughout the duration of the data collection. Study tools are piloted and tested by the research team who requests patient and provider input during this process. Participants are given the opportunity to indicate any additional comments throughout data collection so that we may take their priorities, experiences and preferences into account. Patients (parents and adolescents) and providers assist us in additional recruitment efforts as described in the Methods and design section. All participants were informed of the amount of time their participation would entail prior to data collection. We systematically request participants&#x2019; wishes to receive the results of the study by including an item on the consent form allowing them to provide us with their contact information. We will send relevant published results to study participants and invite them to public forums where we discuss our study results. As approved by the ethics committee, all questionnaire items include &#x2018;do not wish to answer&#x2019; categories, given the personal and sensitive nature of certain questions, in particular those regarding religion and political views. In accordance with the Human Research Act (), adolescents (defined as individuals 14 years of age or older) who are capable of judgement are able to provide informed consent in writing and do not need to provide informed consent in writing from a legal representative &#x2018;if the research project entails more than minimal risks and burdens&#x2019; (, Art 23, Par 1). Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz has approved of this study as entailing less than minimal risks and burdens and thus does not require informed consent in writing from a legal representative for adolescents. Informed consent from minor participants (all aged 15 years and older for this study) is obtained directly from the participants and not their legal representatives.

This study shows the predictors of adopting subnational smoke-free laws and their alignment with Article 8 of   The legislations of 125 cities from China&#x2019;s top three city grades were assessed, covering the cities that have smoke-free laws. Logistic regression is applied to evaluate the characteristics of cities that adopted a smoke-free law. We also compare each smoke-free law with the  C Article 8 requirements. Provincial capital cities were more likely to adopt smoke-free laws compared with other cities. Smoke-free laws vary from comprehensive to partial bans with major exemptions. Among the 21 cities that have enacted smoke-free laws, 9 cities prohibited smoking in all indoor workplaces, indoor public places (restaurants, bars, health facilities, government buildings and schools) and public transportation. More than half of the smoke-free laws still allow designated indoor smoking rooms. Smoke-free laws that clearly ban e-cigarettes in smoke-free areas have been implemented in only two cities (Nanning and Hangzhou). This study shows that a number of Chinese cities have taken legislative measures to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke. It identifies signs of progress but also areas for improvement, such as the scope of smoke-free laws, imperfect implementation of such laws, and the potential omission of e-cigarettes from the legislation. Smoking kills more than a million people in mainland China every year As such, implementing comprehensive smoke-free laws that cover indoor workplaces, indoor public places and public transportation provides China with one of the most effective measures to counter premature death and health disparities. Nevertheless, it is a notable achievement that after China ratified the  C in 2005, many cities have issued smoke-free local laws since 2008. In 2013, a comprehensive report from the China Central Party School advocated implementing a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places: . This report was significant not only for its content, but also for the fact that it represented a strong commitment by the Chinese government to take effective measures to provide protection from exposure to tobacco smoke. As of August 2019, many cities in mainland China have adopted subnational smoke-free laws. Some laws are fully compliant with  C Article 8 in requiring a comprehensive smoke-free environment while others still have loopholes that allow smoking in specific indoor areas. Hence, this study evaluated the predictors of subnational smoke-free laws in China and compared each smoke-free law with  C Article 8 requirements, with the goal of providing valuable suggestions for future smoke-free legislation and amendments at the city level. Chinese cities were classified into 5 unofficial grades (Grade I being the highest and V being the lowest rated) according to , per capita income, population, and number of high-level universities, transnational companies and embassies, including other indicators such as transportation situation. The Grade I cities have strong economic foundations and a large number of highly educated middle-class residents, convenient transportation, as well as considerable political resources and regional influence. Based on the above indicators, 19 cities were classified as Grade I, 36 cities as Grade , 74 cities as Grade , 76 cities as Grade , and 200 cities as Grade V, in mainland China. The 129 cities in the top three grades were selected for our research, taking into consideration the influence of smoke-free laws and their benefits. After excluding 4 cities for which data were not available, 125 cities covering the main cities of China with smoke-free legislation were included in the present study. We obtained most laws from the city-level congress or governmental websites, and also from the China Smoke-Free Laws Research Report, and socioeconomic indices from annual provincial statistics including population, , city grade, and provincial capital city. Hygiene information for each city was obtained from the Department of Planning and Information, National Health Commission of China. We used quantitative methods to analyse the data. Descriptive statistics were used to present the overall status of smoke-free laws. Categorical variables were reported as percentages. Logistic regression is applied to evaluate the characteristics of cities that adopted smoke-free laws. . All statistical analyses were conducted in S 19.0. Variables used in this study of smoke-free laws in Chinese cities, 2018 Of the 125 cities, more than half are Grade  cities, 30 are provincial capital cities, and 21 have C-compliant smoke-free laws (, only a few cities adopted smoke-free laws in the first 3 years following ratification of the  C, but the number increased from years 4 and 8 onwards. The characteristics of the 125 cities included in this study assessing smoke-free legislation in China The influence of potential variables on the existence of a smoke-free legislation Date when 21 cities implemented smoke-free law  presents the scope of all subnational smoke-free laws in China. Smoke-free laws vary from comprehensive bans to partial bans with major exemptions. Among the 21 cities that have enacted smoke-free laws, 9 cities have reached or are very close to reaching C Article 8 requirements by prohibiting smoking in all indoor workplaces, indoor public places (restaurants, bars, health facilities, government buildings and schools) and public transportation. For indoor public places, smoke-free laws cover mostly health facilities and schools, followed by government buildings. However, the percentage of smoke-free laws that cover restaurants and bars was relatively low. For public transportation, 66.7% of smoke-free laws prohibit smoking in any vehicle used for the carriage of members of the public, and in waiting areas such as platforms. The scope of all subnational smoke-free laws in China (n=125) &#x221A; &#x2013; Smoke-free law covered area. P &#x2013; Area where smoke-free law is only partially covered. X &#x2013; Area where smoke-free laws are not covered. As seen in , more than half of the smokefree laws still allow designated indoor smoking rooms, and only 8 laws clearly ban indoor smoking areas. For owners or managers of venues, all smokefree laws require &#x2018;No Smoking&#x2019; signs at appropriate locations, and most laws require removal of any smoking-related paraphernalia from the premises and discouragement of individuals from smoking on the premises. The least represented aspects of the laws were those that required the removal of tobacco company advertisements and provision of a telephone number for the public to report violations. Existence of an indoor smoking room and responsibilities of owners or managers of venues in China &#x221A; &#x2013; Responsibilities imposed for owners of venues by smoke-free law.

Smoke-free laws that clearly ban the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free areas were only recently enacted in two cities (Nanning and Hangzhou). This study reports on the . Shenzhen city amended its smoke-free law in 2014 to meet the requirements of the   In addition to the support from the government and the local , the Guangzhou city Tobacco Control Association and International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (Union) funded the legislative process and follow-up surveys to show the effectiveness of the law. According to the models of Diffusion of Innovations, the innovation-decision process involves five steps: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. During the process, people were classified as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. The 21 cities that had enacted smoke-free laws at the time of our study were likely innovators or early adopters and may play a central role at the initial stage of promoting subnational smoke-free laws in China. Their positive evaluations about the legislation and implementation of the law may carry this action forward so that other cities also adopt such legislation.  C Article 8 Guidelines state that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke, that any measures, including air filtration and separate ventilation, cannot protect against exposure to tobacco smoke, and the only effective way to provide protection from exposure to tobacco smoke is to ensure a 100% smoke-free environment. Currently, less than half of smoke-free laws in China comprehensively ban all indoor smoking. This weakness in existing smoke-free laws presents a barrier to achieving a 100% smoke-free environment. International studies have found that adult entertainment venues have higher rates of secondhand smoke exposure compared with other locations in the community. This conclusion calls for continuous efforts with the aim of having a 100% smoke-free bars and restaurants. Smoke-free legislation is the keystone of the  C and  policy package. Enforcement in many cities is facing challenges due to resource constrains, as in most cities of China, so that enforcement agencies cannot conduct regular inspections. In this sense, a reporting hotline is crucial for governments to monitor the implementation of smoke-free laws. In addition, this kind of &#x2018;bottom up&#x2019; enforcement mechanism can mobilize societal and community participation. Banning tobacco advertisements is part of  C Article 13, but our results showed only some smoke-free laws mentioned banning tobacco advertisements, which can negate public health messages on the hazards of tobacco use. Therefore, banning all types of tobacco advertisements, sponsorship and promotion, especially in smoke-free places, will have additional value. Nearly all current smoke-free laws in China fail to mention the use of e-cigarettes. As in many countries, this is a relatively new type of tobacco use in China. Unclear regulation of e-cigarette usage in smoke-free venues in current subnational smoke-free laws can become a potential loophole in the future. Research has found e-cigarettes can pose health risks; a systematic review study, of articles published from 1996 to 2015, concluded that passive exposure to e-cigarette vapour has the potential to lead to adverse health effects. In addition, the use of such devices in smoke-free venues may also present a law enforcement challenge. For example, people may not be able to clearly identify visual clues related to traditional cigarettes versus those of e-cigarettes (i.e. the visual vapor), and this may cause confusion and poor adherence to the existing smoke-free regulations. Despite the challenges that tobacco control legislation and related stakeholders face, we still can identify some opportunities to strengthen tobacco control. First, the Chinese government has been committed to promoting a national smoke-free law since 2011. In 2014, the State Council drafted smoke-free national legislation for a comprehensive smoking ban. Although this law has not been adopted, endeavors that promote political will can pave the way for an effective comprehensive national smoke-free law. In 2016, the Chinese government announced the Healthy China 2030 Plan. It is a new national strategy with ambitious targets including reduction of smoking prevalence from 27.7% in 2015 to 20% by 2030. Moreover, many important C measures such as smoke-free legislation, along with tax increases and other legislation, can contribute to achieving the target reduction in smoking by 2030. This study has some limitations. First, while all the current subnational smoke-free laws were covered, it is possible that some cities that have effective government regulations were missed because the regulations are not classified as &#x2018;laws&#x2019;. Second, our study only focused on the legal text and does not take into account the implementation of the law. Therefore, we had no opportunity to explore this topic in a real-world situation. It is expected that future studies may consider including all the smoke-free policies and also the implementation and compliance with the laws. This study provides new and potentially important information. It shows that, in the absence of a national law, more and more Chinese cities have taken legislative measures to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke. It identified signs of successful progress but also areas for improvement, such as the scope of smoke-free laws, imperfect implementation of such laws, and the omission of e-cigarettes from this discourse. These loopholes are now identified and thus can be remedied. As smoke-free laws need continuous updating, this requires continued commitment from leadership and active participation of stakeholders and media, at all levels.

Accumulating evidence suggests the tumor microenvironment () is correlated with the tumor progress and the patient&#x2019;s outcome. As the major components of , the tumor-infiltrated immune cells and stromal cells have attracted more and more attention. In this study, differentially expressed immune and stromal signature genes were used to construct a -related prognostic model for predicting the outcomes of C patients. The expression profiles of C samples with clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (A) and Gene Expression Omnibus (). The differentially expressed genes (s) related to the  of C were identified using A dataset by Wilcoxon rank sum test. The prognostic effects of -related s were analyzed using univariate Cox regression. Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () regression was performed to reduce the overfit and the number of genes for further analysis. Next, the prognostic model was constructed by step multivariate Cox regression and risk score of each sample was calculated. Then, survival and Receiver Operating Characteristic () analyses were conducted to validate the model using A and  datasets, respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of gene signature was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (A). Finally, the overall immune status, tumor purity and the expression profiles of  genes of high- and low-risk samples was further analyzed to reveal the potential mechanisms of prognostic effects of the model. A total of 93 -related s were identified, of which 23 s were up-regulated and 70 s were down-regulated. The univariate cox analysis indicated that 23 s has the prognostic effects, the hazard ratio ranged from 0.65 to 1.25 ().&#xA0;The A analysis indicated that highly expressed M12, ,  mainly correlated with the activation of pathways involving in focal adhesion, immune regulation. The immune analysis indicated that the low-risk group has more immune activities and higher expression of  genes than that of the high-risk group. In sum, we identified and constructed a three -related s signature, which could be used to predict the prognosis of C patients. Lung cancer is the deadliest malignant disease in the world with about two million new cases and 1.8 million deaths each year&#xA0;(). Although the genetic and epigenetic changes in tumor cells are crucial to the oncogenesis and progress of tumors, accumulating evidence shows that the interaction among the tumor cells and its surrounding normal cells also plays an important role (). The  package defines a set of -related genes which is comprised of immune and stromal signature genes. In this study, the differentially expressed -related genes between C and normal samples were identified using the C transcriptome expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas&#xA0;(A) database. Next, a three-gene signature was constructed and evaluated using independent database and its potential prognostic mechanisms were further analyzed. In conclusion, a three-gene signature associated with C  was constructed, which can be used to predict the  of C patients. Fragments per Kilobase Million (M) normalized expression profile data of C samples were downloaded from A database using  data transfer tool and summarized into an expression matrix. The ensemble ids were converted into gene symbols according to the annotation file (Homo_sapiensCh38.95).

The univariate Cox model was used to determine the relationship between  associated s expression and  The ). The  regression is a popular method for variable selection in fitting high-dimension generalized linear model, which can get a more refined model by constructing a penalty function to reduce the variable numbers and effectively avoid overfitting. Then, the selected key genes were included in multivariate Cox analysis, and risk score formula was constructed according the analysis results. The predictive performance of the -related gene signature was further validated in three  datasets. Samples in the testing datasets were divided into high- and low-risk group according to the formula of risk score derived from the training dataset, respectively. Kaplan&#x2013;Meier () survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic () curve were used to evaluate the predicting power of the gene signature, and the prognostic performance of other clinicopathological factors was also analyzed. We also identified pathways that were up- and down-regulated when the expression level of -related gene signature was changed by gene set enrichment analysis (A 4.0) (). The curated G gene set was downloaded from the ig database. Enrichment  values were based on 1,000 permutations, and  &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistical significance. To explore the potential relationship between immune system and -related gene signature, we analyzed the immune status of the high-risk and low-risk samples. First, using 29 immune signatures, we quantified the immune activities between high-risk and low-risk samples by single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssA) (), and the difference of tumor purities, expression of  genes between high-risk and low-risk samples was further analyzed. Accumulating evidence suggests that tumor progression and patient&#x2019;s prognosis were associated with the . To identify the prognostic C -related genes, differential expression analysis was conducted.

To further explore the relationship between three-gene signature and immune system, ssA method was used to assess the overall immune status of high-risk and low-risk groups by analyzing the expression profiles of the 29 immune signature genesets.

In order to identify prognostic biomarkers associated with C , we first identified the -related s, and constructed a three-gene (M12, , ) signature by  Cox regression model, and validated its association with  in three  test datasets. The results indicated that the three-gene signature can well classified the C patients of training and testing datasets into high- and low-risk groups, and high-risk groups were associated with poorer prognosis. The univariate and multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the three-gene signature can be used as independent prognostic factor for predicting the patients&#x2019; outcome. The  analyses using training, testing datasets also proved the robusticity of our prognostic signature. Although the three genes all belong to stromal signature gene, the  results showed that there was a wide interaction between the stromal signature s and the immune signature s, suggesting that the two types of cells maybe extensively interact in C . Immune and stromal cells infiltrated in  are composed of many different types of cells. On the one hand, as the most abundant stromal cell, the fibroblasts can form physical barriers to avoid the immune recognition and elimination of tumor cells, and they promote the tumor proliferation and metastasis by regulating the extracellular matrix and secreting related cytokines or growth factors&#xA0;(). Although  have no reported association with C, their functions in C initial and progress are worthy further study. To study the potential molecular mechanism of prognostic effects of gene signature, A analysis was conducted. The results show that the expression changes of genes in the prognostic model mainly affect the intercellular adhesion and the pathways related to immune regulation, which provides clues for the further research. To explore the state of immunity in , ssA and  method were used to evaluate the overall immune status and tumor purity in C . Consistent with the A pathway analysis, the overall immune activity of most low-risk groups was higher than that of the high-risk group. Correspondingly, the tumor purity was lower than that of the high-risk group, suggesting that more stromal cells and immune cells were infiltrated in the , and  expression analysis also showed that the key  genes in the low-risk group were highly expressed, suggesting that local immune regulation and response were more active, which partly explained the results of survival analysis. However, the &#xA0;dataset showed greater heterogeneity between the high- and low-risk groups, and the tumor purity was not statistically different, but the  gene expression trend was similar to other datasets, suggesting that although between high- and low-risk groups, there is no difference in the proportion of immune cells and stromal cells infiltrated at , but differences in immune cell function may also affect the prognosis of patients. We used C transcriptome data to identify -related s. From the s, a three-gene signature was constructed and validated for predicting the outcomes of C patients. Further study of these -related genes will provide a new understanding of the potential relationship between  and C prognosis. Click here for additional data file.

Data are from Waves 3&#x2013;5 (2009&#x2013;2015) of the International Tobacco Control () China Survey, a cohort survey of smokers and non-smokers. Logistic regression analyses employing generalised estimating equations assessed changes in smoking prevalence and support for smoke-free laws over time; specific tests assessed whether partial smoking bans implemented in three cities between Waves 3 and 4 had greater impact. Face-to-face surveys were conducted in seven cities (Beijing, Changsha, Guangzhou, Kunming, Shanghai, Shenyang and Yinchuan) and five rural areas (Changzhi, Huzhou, Tongren, Yichun and Xining). In each survey location at each wave, a representative sample of approximately 800 smokers and 200 non-smokers (aged 18+) were selected using a multistage cluster sampling design. Prevalence of smoking (whether respondents noticed smoking inside restaurants, bars and workplaces); smoking rules inside these venues; and support for complete smoking bans in these venues. Although smoking prevalence decreased and support increased over time, neither trend was greater in cities that implemented partial smoke-free laws. Smoking was higher in rural than urban workplaces (62% vs 44%, p&lt;0.01), but was equally high in all restaurants and bars. There were generally no differences in secondhand smoke () exposure between smokers and non-smokers except in rural workplaces (74% vs 58%, p&lt;0.05). Support for comprehensive bans was equally high across locations. Partial laws have had no effect on reducing  in China. There is an urgent need for comprehensive smoke-free laws to protect the public from exposure to deadly tobacco smoke in both urban and rural areas. The high support among Chinese smokers for such a law demonstrates that public support is not a barrier for action. This is the first cohort study to estimate overall levels of smoking in public places and support for smoking bans in both cities and rural areas of China. This study is not a national sample, but in each sampling location&#x2014;seven major cities and five rural areas&#x2014;there is a probability sampling design that led to fully representative samples of smokers and non-smokers in each location, including all of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and in each of the rural areas. Analyses accounted for the complex sampling design through the use of analytical survey weights to represent the population, rescaled to ensure comparability over time. Quasi-experimental tests (difference-in-difference analysis) examined differences between cities that implemented partial bans between survey waves and those where no new laws were implemented. While the study relied on self-report measures, the results are unlikely to be explained by any possible reporting biases as we used consistent methods and measures at each time point to evaluate differences over time. Although studies have shown the weak impact of existing partial smoke-free laws across China and the need for stronger comprehensive laws, Given the variation in tobacco control policies across the country and the growing health threat in rural areas, it is important to examine the impact of smoke-free policies across a wider range of both urban and rural locations in China. This study uses cohort data from three survey waves (2009&#x2013;2015) of the International Tobacco Control () China Survey to examine trends in self-reported exposure to  in public venues and level of support for smoke-free policies in five major cities and five rural areas across China. Results for the most recent survey waves were also compared between cities and rural areas, and between smokers and non-smokers. Data are from the  China Survey, a face-to-face cohort survey of adult smokers and non-smokers (&#x2265;18 years). The Wave 3 (2009) and 4 (2011&#x2013;2012) Surveys were conducted in seven cities: Beijing, Changsha, Guangzhou, Kunming, Shanghai, Shenyang and Yinchuan. At the Wave 5 Survey (November 2013 to July 2015), Changsha and Yinchuan were dropped and five rural areas were added (Changzhi, Huzhou, Tongren, Yichun and Xining). Five waves of the  China Survey have been conducted since 2006; however, the present article reports results from Waves 3&#x2013;5 because a more comprehensive set of key measures for evaluation of smoke-free policies was introduced at Wave 3. In each survey location at each wave, a representative sample of approximately 800 smokers and 200 non-smokers were selected using a multistage cluster sampling design, following the initial sampling design from Wave 1. As in other  Project surveys, respondents who were lost to follow-up in subsequent survey waves were replenished with randomly selected respondents from the population, with the replenishment sample size based on retention rates. In this paper, smokers are those who have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and smoked at least weekly at recruitment. Because individual public places may implement rules on smoking that are more strict than the local level laws, the rules in each venue were assessed at Wave 5 by asking smokers and non-smokers who had visited a bar or restaurant in their city what the no-smoking rule was the last time they visited, and by asking those who work inside a building what the no-smoking rule is in their workplace. The prevalence of smoking in public places was measured at each survey wave by asking all respondents whether they noticed people smoking inside restaurants, bars and workplaces. For workplaces, those who worked indoors were asked whether people smoked in their workplace in the last 6&#x2009;months. For restaurants and bars, those who said they had visited a restaurant/bar in their city in the last 6&#x2009;months were asked whether people were smoking inside at their last visit. At Waves 4 and 5, those who had said &#x2018;smoking was not allowed in any indoor area&#x2019; or &#x2018;no rules or restrictions&#x2019; about the restaurant/bar they last visited were routed to the question differently than those who had said &#x2018;smoking was allowed only in designated areas&#x2019;. Responses from the two pools of respondents to these questions were combined for the estimates of prevalence at Waves 4 and 5. Support for smoke-free policies was evaluated with the question &#x2018;For each of the following public places&#x2014;bars, restaurants, and workplaces&#x2014;please tell me if you think smoking should not be allowed in any indoor areas; should be allowed only in some indoor areas; no rules or restrictions, or don&#x2019;t know?&#x2019; For each venue, those who said smoking should not be allowed in any indoor areas were categorised as supporting a complete smoking ban. All analyses were conducted in  9.4. with  11.0.1. Results were calculated using both unadjusted and covariate-adjusted models, controlling for the following variables: smoking status, sex, age group and time in sample (number of waves completed by each respondent) except where noted. Results were very similar in both models, so only the adjusted results are presented. For most variables, responses of &#x2018;do not know&#x2019;, &#x2018;refused&#x2019; or &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019; were treated as missing; except for measures of support, where &#x2018;do not know&#x2019; responses were treated as valid and included in the denominator. To test changes in the outcome variables between waves, separate logistic regression models (C ) were estimated using generalised estimating equations () assuming exchangeable correlation structure. The stratified multistage sampling design with strata and primary sampling units were also taken into consideration. In the  model, the variances were computed between clusters, whereas the intraclass correlations were computed within the individual respondent since the same questions were asked at each survey wave. Respondents with missing data on the outcome variables were excluded from the  model. Analyses were first conducted separately for smokers and non-smokers, and all respondents were then combined to estimate overall population prevalences over time. For the longitudinal trends, results are shown for the combined sample unless otherwise noted. The longitudinal trends were also conducted among respondents in the cities only (ie, rural areas were excluded from the Wave 5 sample). Within the longitudinal design, a specific quasi-experimental (difference-in-difference) analysis was conducted to examine whether those cities that had implemented partial smoke-free laws between survey waves experienced significantly greater benefits (lower smoking rates, greater support for smoke-free laws) than did those cities where no new (partial) laws were implemented over that same period of time. Finally, analytical survey weights were used to account for the complex sampling design for all the analyses (see ref  for further information on the weights construction for the  China Wave 5 Survey). For the Wave 5 cross-sectional analyses, the Wave 5 inflation weights were applied to represent the actual population across the survey locations at that time. For the longitudinal analyses, the inflation weights from the time of recruitment were applied for each respondent and rescaled by cohort to ensure comparability between and within cohorts, assuming that conditioning on cohort does not affect the model unbiasedness of the individual&#x2019;s term in the  estimating function. As a result, the longitudinal results are comparable between waves, but the Wave 5 only results are not necessarily comparable to the longitudinal results. No patients were involved in deciding the research question, study design, outcome measures or in the interpretation of results. This work uses data provided by survey participants which were securely accessed and stored. There are no plans to disseminate results of the research to study participants. Overall at Wave 5 (2013&#x2013;2015), workplaces were the most likely venue to completely ban indoor smoking (67.2%) compared with restaurants (41.8%) and bars (25.7%) (see ). Comparisons between the cities and rural areas showed that cities were significantly more likely to have a complete ban in workplaces than rural areas (68.8% vs 49.6%, p&lt;0.05). Rural restaurants were more likely to have no rules (38.3% vs 21.1%, p&lt;0.05), but rural bars were less likely to have no rules (16.6% vs 37.2%, p&lt;0.01).

Results are among smokers and non-smokers combined. *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001. In all venues among those surveyed in 2013&#x2013;2015, smoking was much more common in those places where there were no reported rules or restrictions (88%&#x2013;99% across venues), compared with places that had a partial (49%&#x2013;71%) or complete smoking ban (35%&#x2013;58%) (see ). However, even though smoking prevalence was lower in places that had a complete ban, the rates of smoking were still alarmingly high overall&#x2014;especially in bars (58% in bars that reportedly did not allow smoking). Prevalence of smoking in public places with no rules, a partial smoking ban, or a complete ban across all survey locations at Wave 5 (2013&#x2013;2015).

The results for Wave 5 are separated by urban versus rural locations; however, all data for Wave 5 were collected over the same time period (2013&#x2013;2015). Difference between cities versus rural areas and smokers versus non-smokers in prevalence of smoking and support for smoking bans at Wave 5 Bold numbers represent a significant difference between the percentages between groups (cities vs rural areas overall; and smokers vs non-smokers within cities or rural areas). Results were adjusted for gender, age group, smoking status and time in sample; however, time in sample was removed from the model for the noticing smoking in bars results due to its unexpected influence on the adjusted results. *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001. The quasi-experimental test of the impact of partial smoke-free laws showed a larger decrease in workplace smoking in the three cities that implemented a partial smoking ban between Waves 3 and 4 (Yinchuan, Shanghai and Guangzhou; average decrease of 25.1%) compared with the four cities that did not implement any laws between Waves 3 and 4 (Beijing, Changsha, Kunming and Shenyang; average decrease of 6.6%); however, the difference was not significant (p=0.06). From Waves 3&#x2013;5, the majority of respondents in almost all survey locations (cities and rural) who had visited a restaurant in the last 6&#x2009;months reported that people were smoking inside the restaurant during their last visit&#x2014;reflecting the fact that only 42% of these restaurants reportedly had a complete smoking ban (see ). However, there was no significant difference (p=0.488) in the decrease in restaurant smoking in the three cities where partial laws were implemented between Waves 3 and 4 (average decrease of 21.3%) compared with the four cities where no new laws were implemented (16.0% decrease). Smoking prevalence was highest overall in bars across the survey waves (84%&#x2013;93% of cities at Wave 3; 86% overall) (see ). Results varied across survey locations at Wave 5 due to small sample sizes among non-smokers, but remained high overall (61% in cities), and actually increased over time in Kunming (94% at Wave 5). As there were no smoke-free laws covering bars implemented during the survey period, differences between cities were not analysed. As shown in , there were no significant differences in noticing smoking in restaurants, bars or workplaces between smokers and non-smokers in cities. In the rural areas, there were no differences for restaurants and bars, but smokers were more likely to report people smoking in their indoor workplace than non-smokers (74% vs 58%, p&lt;0.05). Support for smoking bans in public places was high overall among Chinese smokers and non-smokers and increased in most cities from Waves 3&#x2013;5. Support was highest for total smoking bans in indoor workplaces (52%&#x2013;84% across cities at Wave 5; 75% overall in cities; see ). Support for total smoking bans in indoor areas of restaurants also increased across the cities from Waves 3&#x2013;5 (50%&#x2013;68% at Wave 5; 62% overall) (see ). However, support did increase slightly overall from Waves 3&#x2013;5. There were no significant differences in support for smoking bans between those cities that implemented a partial smoke-free law between Waves 3 and 4 and those that did not, for either workplaces (average increase of 14.4% vs 10.9%; p=0.553), restaurants (18.6% vs 16.1%, p=0.676) or bars (16.7% vs 13.5%, p=0.630). As shown in , there were no differences in support for complete smoking bans in restaurants, bars and workplaces between cities and rural areas at Wave 5. Overall, support for smoke-free public places was high among all respondents but was higher among non-smokers compared with smokers at Wave 5 (see ). In the five cities, non-smokers were more likely than smokers to support complete smoking bans in restaurants (63% vs 54%, p&lt;0.05) and workplaces (75% vs 63%, p&lt;0.001), but there was no difference in support for smoke-free bars (42% vs 37%, p=0.296). Smokers and non-smokers in the rural areas did not differ in support. This study demonstrates that partial smoke-free laws in China have not led to significant reductions in &#x2014;a hazard that kills 100&#x2009;000 people every year&#x2014;and supports the urgent need for strong comprehensive smoke-free laws in China. During 2013&#x2013;2015, fewer than half of all restaurants and one-quarter of bars that smokers and non-smokers last visited had complete smoking bans, and exposure to  in both urban and rural areas remains extremely high. This study also highlights the high level of support for total smoking bans in China, even among smokers. Overall in 2013&#x2013;2015, about two-thirds of all respondents (smokers and non-smokers combined) thought there should be a complete smoking ban in workplaces (62% in rural areas, 73% in cities), and over half of respondents supported a complete ban in restaurants (56% in rural areas, 61% in cities). Support was lower for complete smoking bans in bars (44% in rural areas, 41% in cities), but still increased among both smokers and non-smokers from 2009 to 2015. The levels of support for smoke-free public places among smokers in China (ie, from 37% for bars to 63% for workplaces among smokers in cities at Wave 5) are all higher than in every other  country prior to the implementation of comprehensive smoke-free laws, including Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Germany and the Netherlands&#x2014;all of which experienced very substantial decreases in smoking after the ban, and most of which saw a significant increase in support among smokers after implementation. Support for smoke-free public places in China was even higher among non-smokers than smokers in 2013&#x2013;2015, and there were no differences in support between urban and rural locations, demonstrating that comprehensive smoke-free laws would be very popular among all of the Chinese public. Although previous studies in China using data from the 2010 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (S) and 2015 Tobacco Questions for Surveys () have examined rates of smoking in public places in urban and rural areas, the present study is the first cohort study of both smokers and non-smokers and in both cities and rural China to estimate overall population levels of smoking in public places and support for smoke-free laws, and to explicitly compare smokers and non-smokers in urban versus rural areas, where rates of smoking and smoking-related mortality are rising. The results showed that in both cities and rural locations, smoking was most likely to be observed in venues (workplaces, restaurants and bars) that had no rules about indoor smoking, and least likely to be observed in venues with a complete ban. These findings suggest that individual public venues can achieve success in reducing  exposure by implementing no-smoking rules that are stronger than what is required by local and national-level laws. It should be noted, however, that such bans in individual establishments are rare in China. In addition, despite the greater impact of complete smoking bans over partial bans on reducing smoking in public places, complete bans still did not eliminate smoking across all establishments. Smoking was still observed in 35% of workplaces, 38% of restaurants and 58% of bars that reportedly had a complete smoking ban in place at the time of the survey, demonstrating that enforcement of smoke-free laws was weak and remains a challenge in China. This is consistent with previous research showing that about 40% of public places where smoking was banned still had smoking in 2010&#x2013;2011. The high smoking prevalence even in places where smoking is banned may also reflect the overall norms and expectations of the public that smoking is acceptable even in the presence of an official ban. It may be the case that if a comprehensive smoke-free law was implemented covering all venues, the norms would shift, and this would support and sustain compliance with that law.

Current strategies for / diagnosis consist of the extraction of a solid tissue from the affected area. This sample enables the study of specific biomarkers and the genetic nature of the tumor. However, the tissue extraction is risky and painful for the patient and in some cases is unavailable in inaccessible tumors. Moreover, a tissue biopsy is expensive and requires a highly skilled gynecological surgery to pinpoint accurately which cannot be applied repeatedly. New alternatives that overcome these drawbacks are rising up nowadays, such as liquid biopsy. A liquid biopsy is the analysis of biomarkers in a non-solid biological tissue, mainly blood, which has remarkable advantages over the traditional method. The most studied cancer non-invasive biomarkers are circulating tumor cells (s), circulating tumor  (ct), and circulating free  (cf). These circulating biomarkers play a key role in the understanding of metastasis and tumorigenesis, which could provide a better insight into the evolution of the tumor dynamics during treatment and disease progression. Liquid biopsy is an emerging non-invasive, safe and effective method with considerable potential for clinical diagnosis and treatment management in patients with  and  Analysis of cf and ct will provide a better characterization of biomarkers and give rise to a wide range of clinical applications, such as early detection of /, the prediction of treatment responses due to the discovery of personalized tumor-related biomarkers, and therapeutic response monitoring. In recent years, the continuous development in genomic detection and analysis technology has revealed a more complicated molecular picture of cancers. Such complexity may be caused by the inter/intra-tumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution, which brings forward a higher demand on a precise and real-time monitoring system. Ovarian cancer (), endometrial cancer () and cervical cancer () are the three major cancers in gynecology. Established screening projects and the prevalence of vaccination have remarkably reduced the incidence and mortality of invasive , but the situation of  and  is still not optimistic. Ovarian cancer is an aggressive disease with a high mortality rate, largely due to a lack of effective screening methods or biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity. Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer occurring in female reproductive tract. while the invasive process and possible complications may reduce the compliance of patients. More importantly, it could not be used in the treatment surveillance once the uterus is removed. Histopathology examination has long been regarded as the gold standard for the final diagnosis and genotypic analysis of  and  However, tissue biopsy is incompatible for clinical longitudinal monitoring due to its invasive nature. Based on the above, a new strategy for these two types of gynecological malignancies is urgently needed. As a non-invasive and cost-effective method, liquid biopsy is expected to overcome the above shortcomings and has become a research hotspot. providing us with important information. In our review, we will focus on the potential value of cf/ct in  and  patients. It took about 30 years from the first discovery of cf in the blood of healthy people Since then, more studies have focused on this circulating molecular, especially its potential role in cancer management. A great proportion of cf comes from normal cells of the body, a small part of which is related to tumors, coming from primary tumors, metastatic sites or s, and is called ct. The mechanism of cf being released by cells into circulation was still not fully understood. Mouliere et al Analysis of ct paves us the way for a comprehensive view of the tumor genomic landscape. The ct fragments (~134-144 bp) were reported to be shorter than that of cf (~166bp). For blood collection, the ratio of plasma germline cf is lower than that of serum; thus, it is more suitable for ct isolation. After centrifugation, the separated plasma should be stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C for later use. The extraction of cf/ct is the key to the subsequent test. Available methods include phase isolation, silicon membrane-based spin column, and magnetic bead-based isolation. New techniques have emerged with high sensitivity and high specificity for the analysis of cf or ct from a quantitative and qualitative perspective, such as polymerase chain reaction () strategies and Next-Generation Sequencing () strategies. There is a variety of -based methods, each with its characteristics, including real-time , co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-, methylation-specific , digital  or droplet digital  (dd), &#x201C;Beads, Emulsion, Amplification, Magnetics digital &#x201D; (Ming) and so on. Designed to detect hotspot mutations, these -based methods are relatively time-saving and economical. Next-Generation Sequencing ()-based methods such as tagged-amplicon deep sequencing (TamSeq), the Safe Sequencing System (SafeSeqS), ncer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing (P-Seq) and targeted error correction sequencing (-Seq) are available to assess genetic alterations with different detection capacities. Though efficient, these methods are relatively time-consuming and require professional bioinformatics analysis. As a promising effective tool in oncology, cf/ct is of essential value in clinical management of ovarian and endometrial cancer patients from the diagnostic, predictive and prognostic aspects ( , ovarian cancer; , endometrial cancer; b, branched ; -P, -restriction fragment length polymorphism; , loss of heterozygosity; , microsatellite instability; , next-generation sequencing; mt, mitochondrial ; dd, digital droplet ; s, peripheral blood leukocytes; , methylation-specific ; , copy number variation; , do not know. Applications of cf/ct in ovarian or endometrial cancer patients.&#xA0; As previously mentioned, the diagnostic value of blood markers and imaging examinations for early detection and differential diagnosis of ovarian and endometrial tumors is limited. Plenty of studies have been carried out to evaluate the competency of cf/ct in cancer screening. Changes in levels of cf/ct can be a hint for the existence of malignance, which could be more accurate than 125 or 4 in some  studies. Shao et al reported a significant increment of cf levels in the  group compared with the control group (P&lt;0.01). They also noticed a higher sensitivity and specificity (88.9% and 89.5%) of cf than 125 (75% and 52.6%) and 4 (80.6% and 68.4%) in  detection. Sensitivity and specificity were promoted (91.67% and 84.21%) when the above biomarkers were combined. The role of cf levels for  screening and classification appears to be controversial. Significantly elevated total cf levels were detected in  group compared with the controls, with higher levels in high-grade groups (G2 and G3). With regard to  patients, Sun et al conducted a special research on mitochondrial  (mt) copy number detection in peripheral blood leukocytes (s) rather than serum or plasma. Alteration of  methylation has been proven to be an early event of tumorigenesis, making the analysis of circulating  methylation patterns a potential method to detect  and  Published studies applied similar research methods for , while focused on different genes. may be promising as a marker that warrants further investigations. Margolin et al developed a study to detect the hypermethylation of the  Analysis of cf/ct allows doctors to gain insight into tumor burden, thus providing references for subsequent treatment. Information on survival outcomes predicted by cf/ct could assist us in developing therapeutic projects and personal follow-up plans for cancer patients. A significant discrepancy of cf levels between stage I- and stage - (P&lt;0.01) was reported based on an analysis of 36  cases, Relative researches about  are rarely seen, but one has found that the appearance of plasma  mutations was remarkably correlated with primary tumor size. Several studies drew similar conclusions on the prognostic role of cf levels, that is, an increased cf levels indicate a significant reduction in overall survival () in  patients. Plasma  mutations in  patients were found to be significantly related to deep myometrial invasion and lymphatic/vascular invasion, suggesting a possibly poorer survival outcome than those with only wildtype . Postoperative residual disease may occur in advanced  and  patients even under standard surgical procedures. As a potential source of relapse, it poses a serious threat to the patient&#x2019;s survival outcome. As aforementioned, despite emerging new treatment strategies, recurrences of  and  remain as urgent problems to be resolved. The evaluation of residual tumor burden and recurrence is thus important, and cf/ct may offer assistance. Wimberger et al demonstrated that serum  levels of  patients were significantly correlated with postoperative residual tumor load of &gt;1 cm (p=0.0001) and a higher risk of relapse (p=0.002). ct may provide opportunities of timely treatment of recurrent lesions that were not detectable through imaging. One research revealed that ct could make a diagnosis for relapsed  cases 7 months earlier than  scanning. Levels of cf were evaluated in a cohort of 25  patients before and after operation, and 3 cases whose postoperative cf levels did not decrease as expected relapsed during the follow up. As the molecular mechanisms of tumors continue to unlock, different types of targeted drugs have been validated in clinical trials. Treatment resistance occurs commonly, possibly because of the genomic heterogeneity or tumor subclonal evolution under selection pressure. Real-time monitoring of therapeutic response is pivotal as it helps to understand the dynamic development of the disease. Detection of cf/ct may achieve the goal of screening out potential drug-resistant patients and instituting candidate-tailored therapeutic project to reduce the recurrence rate and improving survival rate. Several studies, including a study of the  mouse model, reported a decrease in cf levels after ovarian cancer treatment, and some studies have shown that it is associated with post-therapy survival. Recently, a couple of studies have been developed to explore the acquisition of  reversion mutations in cf/ct has been proven to be useful to predict possible drug resistance and guide treatment strategies. Matulonis et al conducted a study to assess treatment response of 3K inhibitor pilaralisib in advanced or recurrent  cases. Different degrees of consistency were noticed between ct and paired tumor tissue on the status of  Advanced techniques, including detection techniques of cf/ct, have improved the detection rate of early-stage disease. Choices of fertility-sparing approaches for gynecological cancer patients are receiving greater attention, since an increasing number of patients are diagnosed at productive age and desire to have children. Gynecological cancers have a negative impact on the sexuality and fertility of patients, increasing their stress level and reducing personal identity, which may pose a threat to the quality of their lives. Most  cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, for whom cytoreduction remains optimal. However, fertility-sparing surgery is still recommended for selected patients by several society recommendations, with the premise of a comprehensive surgical staging. As for  patients, total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without surgical staging are regarded as the standard treatment. Fertility-sparing surgery is a choice for reproductive-aged patients with stage  type I and G2  Given the risk of recurrences, monitoring must be strengthened for patients receiving conservative treatment. Non-invasive detection of cf/ct provides a more convenient tool for tracking disease progression, which helps to assess treatment response. Nevertheless, no relative data have been published by now, and the application of cf/ct analysis in this field needs further investigations. The incidence of cancer in elderly population is much higher than the young group. However, the management of elderly patients remains a challenge. In the clinical setting, treatment patterns of elderly patients with  and  often differ from younger patients, and are less aggressive, due to their seemingly fragile bodies. The detection of cf/ct may act as an assistant examination during the whole course of the management, given its non-invasive nature. In addition to blood, cf/ct is also detectable in other body fluids, among which urine, peritoneal fluid and uterine lavage fluid were reported to be utilized in the management of  or  patients ( , ovarian cancer; , endometrial cancer; , loss of heterozygosity; , microsatellite instability; , methylation-specific ; , copy number variation; , next-generation sequencing; Pap, Papanicolaou. Several studies focused on tumor-specific genetic alterations of  extracted from peritoneal fluid samples of  patients, receiving relatively high sensitivities in detection. On June 1, 2016, cobas R Mutation Test v2 was approved by the   Food and Drug Administration () to identify patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer () appropriate for treatment with Tarceva Currently, no cf/ct-related test has been approved by  in the field of  and  Encouragingly, as mentioned above, published studies supported the feasibility of cf/ct&#x2019;s application in the interrogation of tumor genome profiles and real-time tracing of the tumor conditions in  and  patients. The analysis of levels, genetic changes and epigenetic alterations of cf/ct hold tremendous promise in a wide range of applications: cancer screening, tumor burden evaluation, prognosis assessment,  detection, recurrence surveillance and treatment monitoring. In addition, a large number of clinical trials exploring the role of cf/ct in the management of  and  are underway (for example, 03691012), which may provide us with strong evidence. It should be noted that well-defined preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical protocols are the prerequisites to obtain convincing results from large-scale clinical trials. Efforts are still needed to overcome challenges in detection techniques such as low amounts of cf/ct and high background signals. Combination of this new liquid biopsy method with other traditional methods may yield more satisfactory results. Accumulated evidence for survival benefits is required to integrate this novel diagnostic approach into the clinical scenario in the foreseeable future.

Co-infections (or mixed infections) can result in competitive interactions between strains with important consequences for strain abundance and transmission. Here we used the spirochete bacterium,  in the nymphs declined by 40.5% over a period of 3 months, but this phenomenon was not influenced by the seasonal treatment. Future studies should investigate whether inter-strain competition in the tick influences the subsequent strain-specific transmission success from the tick to the vertebrate host. Many infections consist of multiple strains or genotypes of the same pathogen, which are called co-infections (Read and Taylor, ). In the case of vector-borne pathogens, mixed infections can occur in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Numerous studies have investigated interactions between pathogen strains in the vertebrate host (Bruce et al., ). Taken together, these observations suggest that temperature (and other abiotic variables) could influence the outcome of the interactions between strains in mixed infections in the arthropod vector, but to date there are no studies on this subject. In the present study, we used the tick-borne spirochete, ). In areas where Lyme borreliosis is endemic, mixed infections in the nymph are common (Qiu et al., ). In summary, Lyme disease is an interesting system for studying whether inter-strain competition changes over the life cycle of a long-lived arthropod vector and whether this competition is influenced by abiotic factors like temperature. We recently used an experimental infection approach to show that strains of  ticks, and whether this competition is influenced by seasonal treatment. We made three predictions with respect to the interactions between interstrain competition, life cycle stage, and seasonal treatment. First, competition between strains would occur at each of the three life cycle stages: engorged larvae, 1-month-old nymphs, and 4-month-old nymphs. Second, the nymphal spirochete load would decrease with nymphal age and that competition between strains would be more intense in the older nymphs. Third, the nymphal spirochete load would decrease quickly under summer conditions but remain static under winter conditions. In a previous study, we investigated competition between two strains of  at three different time points of the tick life cycle.  alleles used in this study (A3 and A10) have a genetic distance of 23.19% and an amino acid distance of 62.57%. The concatenated sequences of these two Ts differ at 9 base pairs over 4,785 bp (i.e., they are 99.81% similar). The details of this experimental infection study were described in Genn&#xE9; et al. ( nymphs.  A10 allele, respectively. Mice in the co-infection treatment ( q. The prevalence of infection was 70.0% (7/10) for the Fin-Jyv-A3 nymphs and 71.4% (10/14) for the 4049 nymphs. Thus, the expected number of infected nymphs to which the mice were exposed was 3.50 for strain Fin-Jyv-A3 and 3.57 for strain 4049. The mean spirochete load in the subset of infected nymphs was ~380 for the Fin-Jyv-A3 nymphs and ~198 for the 4049 nymphs. Assuming that the number of spirochetes inoculated by a nymph into a mouse is linearly related to the product of the number of infected nymphs and the mean spirochete load per infected nymph, we calculate that the infectious dose for strain Fin-Jyv-A3 (3.57 infected nymphs*380 spirochetes/nymph = 1,356) was almost two times larger than the infectious dose for strain 4049 (3.50 infected nymphs*198 spirochetes/nymph = 694 spirochetes). At 34 days post-infection, each infected mouse was infested with ~100 pathogen-free . Sample sizes are shown for immature  ticks that were collected in our previous study (1-month-old nymphs) and the present study (larvae and 4-month-old nymphs). . When the 4-month-old nymphs were 1 month old, they were randomly assigned to one of three seasonal treatments: artificial summer, artificial winter, and natural winter (). The nymphs spent a total of 3 months in these three seasonal treatments (22 January 2016&#x2013;15 April 2016). In the artificial summer treatment, the nymphs were kept in a phytotron [4&#x2013;5 h: 1 lumen (lm), 21.5&#xB0;C; 5&#x2013;19 h: 2 lm, 25&#xB0;C; 19&#x2013;20 h: 1 lm, 21.5&#xB0;C; 20&#x2013;4 h; 0 lm, 18&#xB0;C] with a relative humidity of 85%. In the artificial winter treatment, the nymphs were kept in a fridge at a temperature of 4&#xB0;C and with no light. For the natural winter treatment, the nymphs were kept in a plastic box (30 cm &#xD7; 23 cm &#xD7; 10 cm) that was buried in the soil at a depth of 10 cm in a forest in the botanical garden of Neuch&#xE2;tel. The box contained three button logs that measured the temperature every 30 min. The mean daily average temperature in the natural winter treatment was 6.44&#xB0;C (range = 3.72&#x2013;10.50&#xB0;C; for details see Section 1 in the ). In each of the three seasonal treatments, the nymphs were kept in their individual Eppendorf tubes. Four months after the larva-to-nymph molt (15 April 2016), the 4-month-old nymphs were checked to determine whether they were alive or dead. The survival was very high, only 4 of the 444 nymphs had died (3, 0, and 1 in the artificial summer, artificial winter, and natural winter, respectively). The next day (16 April 2016), all live 4-month-old nymphs were frozen at &#x2212;20&#xB0; The seasonal treatments, mouse sample sizes, and tick sample sizes are shown in .

The  q differed with respect to the infection status of the tick. Generalized linear mixed effects models (Ms) with binomial errors were used to analyse the infection status of the ticks (0 = uninfected, 1 = infected). The fixed factor that combined tick age class and seasonal treatment had 5 levels: engorged larvae, 1-month-old nymphs, phytotron 4-month-old nymphs, fridge 4-month-old nymphs, and underground 4-month-old nymphs. These levels were combined to create new factors with fewer levels: tick age (3 levels: larvae, 1-month-old nymphs, and 4-month-old nymphs), and tick stage (2 levels: larvae and nymphs). Mouse  was modeled as a random factor. To determine the statistical significance of the fixed factors, models that differed with respect to the fixed factor of interest were compared using log-likelihood ratio () tests. Similarly, comparing a model that includes the 5 levels of tick age class and seasonal treatment with a model that contains 3 levels of tick age, tests whether the seasonal treatment had a significant effect on the phenotype of the 4-month-old nymphs. The total spirochete abundance inside the ticks (hereafter referred to as total spirochete load) was analyzed for the subset of ticks infected with -transformed to normalize the residuals. The fixed factors were the same as for the M of infection status. Mouse  was modeled as a random factor. Ms with binomial errors and s with normal errors were used to analyse the strain-specific prevalence and the strain-specific spirochete load, respectively. The fixed factor that combined tick age class and seasonal treatment (5 levels: engorged larvae, 1-month-old nymphs, phytotron 4-month-old nymphs, fridge 4-month-old nymphs, and underground 4-month-old nymphs), the strain (2 levels: Fin-Jyv-A3, 4049), competition (2 levels: no, yes), and their interactions were fixed factors. Mouse identity was included as a random factor. As before, we tested whether the 5-level factor of tick age class and seasonal treatment could be reduced to tick age (3 levels: larvae, 1-month-old nymphs, and 4-month-old nymphs), or tick stage (2 levels: larvae and nymphs). To determine the statistical significance of the fixed factors, models that differed with respect to the fixed factor of interest were compared using  tests. The results from this stepwise model simplification approach were compared with a model selection approach based on the Akaike information criterion (). The statistical analyses were done in R v. 1.1.463 and using the following R packages: base, lme4, emmeans, and Mun. The &#x201C;lmer&#x201D; and &#x201C;glmer&#x201D; functions (lme4 package) were used to create the Ms and s. The &#x201C;anova&#x201D; function (base package) was used to perform the log-likelihood ratio tests. The &#x201C;model.sel&#x201D; function (Mun package) was used to perform the -based model selection. The &#x201C;emmeans,&#x201D; &#x201C;contrast,&#x201D; and &#x201C;pairs&#x201D; functions (emmeans package) were used for the ). Of the 40 mice used in this study, 2 mice died (S5 and S12), 1 mouse did not become infected (S37), and 4 mice in the co-infected treatments acquired only one strain (S17, S20, S25, S29). Ticks produced by these 7 mice were excluded from the study. For the engorged larvae and the 1-month-old nymphs, the final sample size was 33 infected mice that were distributed across the four infection treatments as follows: Fin-Jyv-A3 (). Of the 849 ticks in this study, 49 were excluded because the  = 118). The infection prevalence is defined as the percentage of ticks that tested positive for  infection in the nymphs (85.0% = 559/658) was 2.3 times higher compared to the larvae (37.3% = 53/142). The statistical analysis of these infection prevalences is presented in the next section. The prevalence of  ticks are shown separately for the seasonal treatment, tick age, and tick stage. . We analyzed the prevalence of ). There was a significant effect of age on infection prevalence ( test of age vs. null: &#x394; df = 2, &#x394; dev = 146.16  = 0.249). The spirochete load is defined as the total number of spirochetes in an infected tick (ignoring strain identity). The geometric mean spirochete loads were calculated for the subset of infected ticks ( = 295; mean = 3,009; range = 36&#x2013;275,423). The spirochete load in the 1-month-old nymphs was 11.8 times higher compared to the larvae and 1.7 times higher compared to the 4-month-old nymphs. Over the 3-month overwintering period, the nymphs lost spirochetes at a rate of 22.7 spirochetes per day. The statistical analysis of these spirochete loads is presented in the next section. We analyzed the total ). There was a significant effect of tick age on the tick spirochete load ( test of age vs. null: &#x394; df = 2, &#x394; dev = 124.65, ). The  = 357). The boxplot shows the medians (black line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (edges of the box), the minimum and maximum values (whiskers), and the outliers (solid circles). Here the response variable is the strain-specific infection prevalence in the immature ticks, as estimated by the ). Thus, the strain-specific prevalence was analyzed as a function of three fixed factors: strain, competition, tick stage, and their interactions. A classic step-wise model simplification approach using  tests found that the best model included strain, competition, tick stage, the competition: tick stage interaction, and the strain:competition interaction (see Section 5 in the ). The presence of two significant two-way interactions complicates the interpretation of the main effects and requires splitting the statistical analyses. We ran separate analyses for larvae and nymphs; this approach allowed us to independently test the effects of competition and strain for each tick stage. In the larvae, the interaction between strain and competition was significant (E : &#x394; df = 1, &#x394; dev = 8.228, ). The strain-specific infection prevalences in the immature  strain, and competition. The proportion of immature  is shown as a function of three factors: (1) tick age (engorged larvae, 1-month-old nymphs, and 4-month-old nymphs), (2) strain (Fin-Jyv-A3 in blue and 4049 in red), and (3) competition (competition absent in solid colors vs. competition present in white). The proportion of ticks infected with the focal strain is an estimate of strain-specific host-to-tick transmission. The graph shows the raw data and not all observable differences are statistically significant. According to the parameter estimates of our statistical analysis, competition between strains in co-infected mice reduced host-to-tick transmission of strain Fin-Jyv-A3 to engorged larvae and nymphs and reduced the host-to-tick transmission of strain 4049 to nymphs. In contrast, competition between strains in co-infected mice did not influence the host-to-tick transmission of strain 4049 to engorged larvae. Each data point represents the mean for a single mouse. The boxplots show the medians (black line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (edges of the box), the minimum and maximum values (whiskers), and the outliers (solid circles). In the nymphs, the interaction between strain and competition was not significant (E : &#x394; df = 1, &#x394; dev = 2.724, ). Here the response variable is the strain-specific spirochete load in the immature ticks, as estimated by combining the ). Thus, the strain-specific spirochete load was analyzed as a function of three fixed factors: strain, competition, tick age and their interactions. A classic stepwise model simplification approach using  tests found that none of the interactions were significant and that the best model contained the three fixed factors of strain, competition, and tick age (see Section 6 in the ). The three fixed factors all had significant effects on the spirochete load: tick age ( test: &#x394; df = 2, &#x394; dev = 86.393, ). The  ticks compared to strain 4049. Each data point represents the mean for a single mouse. The boxplots show the medians (black line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (edges of the box), the minimum and maximum values (whiskers), and the outliers (solid circles). The strain-specific spirochete loads in the subset of infected  strain, and competition. . Our study found that co-infection in the rodent host reduced host-to-tick transmission success of both strains of ). Interestingly, our study shows that reduced host-to-tick transmission can be detected in engorged larval ticks immediately following drop-off. This observation reinforces the idea that competition between strains in the tissues of the rodent host (Strandh and R&#xE5;berg, ). To date, very few studies have investigated interactions between pathogen strains in the arthropod vector (Reif et al.,  sl in the nymph influences subsequent nymph-to-host transmission of the bacterium. The population size of ). The ability of ). One explanation for the observed decrease in the spirochete population over time is bloodmeal digestion, which is a slow process in ixodid ticks that occurs in the gut epithelium rather than the gut lumen (Sonenshine, ). We expected that the intensity of inter-strain competition would increase with this age-related decline in the spirochete population, but we found no evidence that competition was stronger in the 4-month-old nymphs compared to the 1-month-old nymphs. One limitation of our q-based approach is that it allows us to estimate spirochete abundance but not spirochete viability, which may decline with advanced nymphal age. The mechanisms underlying the competition between  sl. Our study found that competition between strains reduced the strain-specific spirochete loads in ). Future experimental infection studies should test whether co-infection in the nymph reduces strain-specific nymph-to-host transmission. The results of our laboratory experiment are relevant to understanding what happens in nature. Studies on wild  populations. We found no effect of seasonal treatment on the ). Thus, the present study demonstrates that the nymphal spirochete load also decreases over time when nymphs are housed under more natural &#x201C;winter-like&#x201D; conditions. The survival of the nymphs over the 3-month winter treatments was very high (99.1%) due to the mild temperatures (6.44&#xB0;C in natural winter and 4.00&#xB0;C in artificial winter). Storing ticks in separate Eppendorf tubes and burying them underground is a promising approach for measuring individual tick survival under natural winter conditions. In studies that investigate competition between pathogen strains, it is critical to control the infectious dose () with which the vertebrate host is infected (de Roode et al., ), strain 4049 was still able to reduce the performance of strain Fin-Jyv-A3. This observation suggests that competitive interactions would remain even if both strains had the exact same  Alternatively, one could infect mice via needle inoculation of spirochete cultures, which can be more easily quantified, but this artificial approach creates other problems. Tick saliva enhances the ability of  sl spirochetes have co-evolved with ticks and not needles. Using ticks will generally give a better reflection of what occurs in nature. This study found that co-infection in the mice reduced the strain-specific host-to-tick transmission success to larval ticks and that this effect was maintained for both strains in the resultant nymphs at 1 and 4 months after the larva-to-nymph molt. This study also demonstrates that competition between strains of  ticks. Inter-strain competition resulted in decreased spirochete loads for both strains in all three ages of immature ticks investigated in our study. The 3-month-long seasonal treatments did not affect the strain-specific spirochete load nor the intensity of inter-strain competition in the 4-month-old nymphs. Future studies should investigate whether inter-strain competition in the nymph influences the strain-specific nymph-to-host transmission success.

Furthermore, we downloaded 71 whole genome sequences representing the global distribution of canonical  lineages and used them to verify the phylogenetic positioning. To this end, we analyzed and compared the genome sequences using canonical s and the whole genome -based analysis. Our results demonstrate that the outbreak strain belonged to the Trans-Eurasian () group r.011/009, which is the predominant clade in Central-Southern Italy. In conclusion, the high genomic relatedness of the Italian  strains suggests their evolution from a common ancestor, while the spread is supposedly driven by trade as well as human and transhumance activities. Here, we demonstrated the capabilities of whole genome sequencing (), which can be used as a tool for outbreak analyses and surveillance activities. Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium ]. Anthrax is a dangerous disease of animals known from ancient times to be also a major concern to humans. The last global report found the disease still widespread, being most prevalent in developing countries and well-controlled within more economically developed countries []. In Italy, animal anthrax is an endemic disease with sporadic episodes occurring usually during hot dry summers and after a rainy springs, but it can be linked to human activities that interfere with soil surfaces []. In the last few decades, Italian anthrax epidemiology has become clearer, and much more is known about the endemic territories, but also new contaminated areas have been recently discovered.  is one of the most genetically homogeneous bacteria. The genotyping methods currently in use are: (i) the analysis of 13 canonical s (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) (cans) that are the most stable and not homoplastic loci useful for phylogenetic investigations and (ii) the multi-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (A) that has higher resolution suitable for outbreak investigations. Using the cans, ]. Group A is subdivided into several sub-groups and sub-lineages scattered throughout the world with specific geographic distribution []. Although cans are useful for resolving the major branches of the . Here we described the  analyses from an anthrax outbreak that occurred in Abruzzo. In order to investigate the origins of the outbreak, we compared the strains against 19 Italian genomes publicly available [ and used them to verify the phylogenetic positioning. To this end, we analyzed and compared the genome sequences using canonical s and whole genome -based analysis. During summer 2016, an anthrax outbreak claimed the lives of four goats in a farm located at Prezza in the Italian region of Abruzzo. This region had neither reported anthrax in the last 50 years nor did any memories about the disease exist among the farmers from the affected districts. One strain (2016.3512.1.7) from the goats was isolated and genotyped for better characterization of the outbreak.  was extracted from the  16 Instrument for automated purification of genomic . Total genomic  was quantified with the Qubit fluorometer (Qubit   Assay, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Eugene, , ) Sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera  library preparation kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, , ) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, producing 150 bp paired-end reads. Can profiles were obtained using 13 allelic discrimination assays involving specific oligonucleotides and probes, as described by Van Ert et al. []. Each 10 &#x3;L reaction mixture contained 1&#xD7; TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, , ), 250 nM probe, 600 nM each of the forward and reverse primer, and approximately 10 ng template . The thermal cycling parameters used were as follows: 10 min at 95 &#xB0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 &#xB0;C and 1 min at 60 &#xB0; Endpoint fluorescent data were acquired by using the 1 7900 instrument. The Can data were compared with the data for 12 recognized sub-lineages or sub-groups. The 14th  was detected using a high-resolution melting assay for a specific r.011 Can [].

The reaction mixture contained 0.2 &#x3;M of each primer and 1&#xD7; Precision Melt Supermix () in a 20 &#x3;L final volume. The following cycling parameters were used: 2 min at 95 &#xB0;C, followed by 35 cycles of 10 s at 95 &#xB0;C and 30 s at 60 &#xB0; The samples were then heated to 95 &#xB0;C for 30 s, cooled down to 60 &#xB0;C over 1 min, and then heated from 65 &#xB0;C to 95 &#xB0;C at a rate of 0.5 &#xB0;C/s. High-resolution melting data were analyzed by using Precision Melt Analysis Software. In order to compare the Abruzzo outbreak strain to the Italian strains, we downloaded raw paired-end sequencing datasets from 19 available strains. In addition, we downloaded 71 diverse paired-end sequencing datasets from the Sequence Read Archive () and used them for worldwide phylogenetic positioning. As part of the download, we extracted epidemiological data and canonical  clades from the dataset published by Sahl et al. [. For analyzing all paired-end sequencing data, we used our in-house pipeline, which is available upon request at GitLab []. The pipeline includes steps for quality control of all samples using  []. Genome assembly of Illumina paired-end reads was performed using shovill []. To identify gene coding for antimicrobial resistance, icate was used against the I database (313047) with  thresholds set at 80% coverage and 75% identity. Genotyping of  Ames Ancestor genome (_000008445.1_844v1) to guide the genome alignments. The alignment output obtained by Parsnp was used to construct a phylogeny of the outbreak strain in comparison to strains collected from different countries. Results were compared to the traditional can typing method. Additionally, we implemented a mapping-based whole genome  analysis using Snippy (v. 4.3.3) [] for visualization of phylogenetic trees together with epidemiological data. The generated reads from the strain (2016.3512.1.7) were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (I) under the bio-project accession number 587863. Genotyping results show that the study strain belongs to canonical  sub-group r.011/009. Whole genome sequencing of the strain resulted in a total of 4,564,206 reads (615,149,873 nucleotides) with a raw average read length of 134 bp (35&#x2013;151 bp) and an average coverage of 109x (). Genome assembly using des generated a draft genome that was composed of 35 contigs of length &gt;500 bp with an N50 contig length of 514,228 bp. The total assembly size of the sequenced strain was 5,450,929 bp representing 99.03% of the reference Ames Ancestor genome (_000008445.1_844v1). In total, we identified 13 virulence genes in the analyzed strain ().

The two virulence plasmids p1 and p2 were identified via the  detection of the plasmid gene markers [). The genomic sequence of the outbreak isolate (study strain) and 90 complete ). The global phylogeny is reported in , in which the information relating to the can group, the country of origin, the host, and the year in which each strain was isolated are reported. As reported by Sahl et al. [], there were three major lineages where group A was the most observed around the world. In group A belonged r.001 and 001/002, r.002/003, r.003/004, r.005/006, r.007, r.009, r. Aust94,  group, and r. Ames, which is also called &#x201C;Ancient A&#x201D;. Italian strains were assigned into two can sub-groups: r.008/011 and r.011/009. The studied outbreak strain belonged to the Trans-Eurasian () sub-group r.011/009 together with all 17 genomes analyzed according to the can analysis. In this cluster, three strains (A0401, A3802 and A1144) coming from France, Ivory Coast, and Argentina were also included. Two Italian strains (A0293 and A0847) were part of the  sub-group 008/011, which was represented by 20 isolates from different countries throughout Europe and Asia. The other two lineages B and C were represented by r.001/002 and r. Kruger (both established in Africa), r.004 (France), and  Br. A1055 and  Br.001, which were found in . The results obtained from  whole genome analyses were used to build the minimum spanning tree () for detailed phylogenetic analysis of the  strains from Italy belonged to the  sub-group r.011/009. The strain (2016.3512.1.7) from the outbreak was featured in the  sub-group r.011/009. The  discovered little genetic diversity among the strains from this study with the closest Sardinian strains (A0894 and A0893) and Apulian strains (A0862B and A0862A) that showed at least 28 s of difference. The other Italian genomes from Apulia, Tuscany, Basilicata, and Lazio showed a higher number of s from the Abruzzo outbreak. For the strains A0891 and A0878, metadata were not available and the geographical origin was not possible to trace. The Carbosap strain was also excluded from the trace back analysis because it is a vaccine strain that was developed decades ago by Italian colleagues attenuating a wild African strain []. The r.008/011, an early branch of  sub-group, was founded in Sicily (A0847) which was different from r.011/009 with 116 s, while there is no information about the geographical origin of the other strain (A0293). Overall, the clustering showed that the Italian isolates were split into five genetic clades, confirming the results by Sahl et al. []. In summary, the distribution of Italian . In this report, can analysis and whole genome sequencing were used to investigate a  outbreak in Italy for the first time. The results from  analysis show a peculiar resistance profile of the study strain; indeed, the presence of resistance genes against vancomycin and macrolides has been found in the Abruzzo strain, although these molecules are usually effective in the therapy of ]. The strain from the outbreak recorded in Abruzzo was compared with 19 isolates from Italy between the period 1972&#x2013;2017, including Carbosap, a vaccine strain with residual pathogenicity, whose first use dates back to the 1940s []. The outbreak isolate was identified to belong to the most prevalent genetic sub-group in Italy, the  r.009/011. The  analysis also found the  Br.008/011 in strains from the main island Sicily. Nonetheless, in this study, we did not find strains belonging to can sub-groups r.  and r.005/006 that were previously found as less prevalent groups in Northeast Italy by Garofolo et al. []. Previous studies registered the  sub-group across Italy supporting the thesis of the introduction of one single ancestor in Italy in the past due to the close similarity of the ]. Although the  sub-group is not exclusive in Italy, its widespread nature suggests rapid and extensive evolution in the Italian fields. The regular droving of livestock that has taken place along the historical green ways known as &#x201C;tratturi&#x201D; might have helped to spread and maintain  in the environment. The most recent common ancestor shared with Southern and Central Italian strains also strengthen the idea that anthrax spread through the movements of livestock along the green ways, and for this reason potentially new contaminated areas will be discovered. Although classic methods of molecular characterization are used in most laboratories, public health facilities should implement the use of  for routine surveillance and outbreak studies []. This study demonstrated the use of  as potential tool for supporting the epidemiological analysis of an outbreak and surveillance activities. The interpretation of data deriving from the combination of epidemiological data and the characterization of ]. Furthermore, our study can contribute to the construction of an analytical workflow involving  data and epidemiological interpretation criteria that can be used by anthrax national reference laboratories around the world. Thus, this work represents a preliminary stage for a future multi-level assessment of the effectiveness of public health of -based typing in surveillance programs and in the analysis of future outbreaks. In the future, through the use of the information suggested by the  data, it will be possible to map the areas at risk for a possible spread of the disease.

This study examines baseline levels of smoking and  exposure in public places and support for smoking bans in Japan prior to the implementation of the 2018 national smoke-free law. Data are from the International Tobacco Control () Japan Wave 1 Survey (Feb&#x2013;Mar 2018), a web survey of adult cigarette smokers, heated tobacco product users, dual users, and non-users (total  = 4684). Measures included prevalence of smoking (whether respondents noticed people smoking inside restaurants and bars at their last visit, and workplaces in the last month), and support for complete smoking bans in these venues. Smoking prevalence in each venue was high overall in 2018 (49% of workplaces, 55% of restaurants, and 83% of bars), even higher than in China, the country with the greatest toll of . Support for complete smoking bans was very high overall (81% for workplaces, 78% for restaurants, and 65% for bars). Non-users were less likely to be exposed to  and had higher support for smoking bans than tobacco users. These findings point to the ineffectiveness of partial smoke-free laws in Japan and reinforce the call for comprehensive smoke-free laws, which even smokers would support at higher levels than in many other  countries. Secondhand smoke () is a significant threat to health, estimated to have killed 1.22 million people globally in 2017 []. Rates of cigarette smoking have declined in Japan in recent years to 18% of adults (30% men, 8% women) in 2015, and are lower than in other Asian countries such as the Republic of Korea and China []. Japan ratified the  C in 2004, but prior to 2018, there was no national smoke-free law. Only two prefectures (Kanagawa in 2010 and Hyogo in 2013) and one city (Bibai in 2016) had implemented their own smoking bans, although these were not comprehensive and lacked strong enforcement []. In light of the upcoming Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games being held in Tokyo from 24 July to 9 August, 2020 (Tokyo 2020), the Health Ministry has taken steps to strengthen smoke-free regulations in Japan. An amendment to the Health Promotion Act banning smoking in all public places was proposed in 2016, but was rejected in 2017 after powerful opposition from the tobacco industry []. In contrast, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government passed its own smoke-free legislation in 2018, which will take effect in April 2020 and is expected to cover 80% of restaurants []. Although still not comprehensive, Tokyo&#x2019;s law is stronger than the national law. The new regulations of the amended Health Promotion Act have also been extended to include heated tobacco products (s) such as S, glo, and Ploom H, which are battery-powered heating devices that heat tobacco rather than burning it, and which have become increasingly popular among smokers in Japan in recent years. Like cigarette smoking,  use will be permitted in designated smoking rooms within new or large-scale eating and drinking establishments only accessible to those aged 20 and older and with signs indicating that smoking is allowed. But unlike cigarette smoking rooms, which are to be used exclusively by smokers without eating or drinking, s will be permitted in areas where people are eating and drinking []. Few jurisdictions in Japan have implemented smoke-free regulations, and the few studies evaluating the effectiveness of smoke-free regulations in Japan have focused on workplaces []. Given the variation in smoke-free policy implementation across venues, jurisdictions, and types of tobacco products in Japan thus far, and the upcoming changes to smoke-free laws, more research is needed to evaluate existing smoke-free policies in public places and develop evidence-based recommendations for more effective smoke-free laws. The present study was designed: (1) to measure current prevalence of smoking in public places (workplaces, restaurants, and bars) as reported by large, representative samples of adult cigarette smokers,  users, and non-smokers at their last visit, and (2) to assess the level of support among Japanese smokers and non-smokers for comprehensive smoke-free laws. These findings aim to complement recent data comparing the rates of  use and cigarette smoking in public places in Japan in 2018 []. This study was conducted in 2018, prior to the implementation of the amended Health Promotion Act. We examined differences between respondent type (particularly smokers vs. non-smokers) on both sets of measures, and we compared Japan to other countries&#x2014;those that have implemented comprehensive laws and those that have partial smoke-free laws.  Data are from the International Tobacco Control () Japan Wave 1 Survey, a web survey of approximately 4500 adults aged 20 and older across 8 geographic regions of the country, who were recruited by email from Rakuten Insight&#x2019;s Japan web panel. The surveys were conducted from 3 February to 2 March 2018, and closed once the quotas for tobacco users and non-users were achieved. The response rate for the Wave 1 Survey was 45.1%. All respondents gave informed consent before participating in the study, and the survey methods and materials were approved by the University of Waterloo Office of Research Ethics ( #31428). The Wave 1 Survey sample was designed to be representative of adult cigarette smokers,  users, dual users, and non-users within each region. . The prevalence of smoking and  exposure in public places was measured by asking all respondents whether they noticed people smoking inside: (a) restaurants, (b) bars, and (c) workplaces, and results are shown for &#x201C;yes&#x201D; responses (Note: the question asked about &#x2018;smoking&#x2019; in general, but was in the cigarette smoking section of the survey, so results are interpreted as referring to cigarette smoking.). Specifically, for workplaces, those who worked indoors were asked whether people smoked in their workplace in the last month. For restaurants and bars, those who said they had visited a restaurant/bar in their city in the last six months were asked whether people were smoking inside at their last visit. Support for smoke-free policies was measured by asking respondents whether they support or oppose a total ban on smoking cigarettes in: (a) restaurants, (b) bars, and (c) workplaces, and (d) whether they support a ban on smoking at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. For each question, results are shown for responses of &#x201C;support&#x201D; and &#x201C;strongly support&#x201D; combined (vs. &#x201C;oppose&#x201D;, &#x201C;strongly oppose&#x201D;, or &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;).  All analyses were conducted in  with  V11 using the multilog procedure (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, , ). All results were adjusted for demographic variables (sex and age group). Analytical cross-sectional survey weights were used to account for the complex sampling design for all the analyses to make respondents within each of the user subgroups representative of the corresponding population with respect to demographics and region. As shown in , smoking prevalence in public places in Japan was high overall. Almost half of workplaces (49%) had people smoking inside in the last month; over half of restaurants (55%), and 83% of bars had smoking the last time respondents visited these places. Because the cross-sectional weights were calibrated to the population numbers of each of the mutually exclusive user groups, crossed with the 8 geographical regions of Japan, sex, and 4 age groups of the population of Japan aged 20 years and above, these weighted percentages of observed smoking can be taken to be national estimates of smoking prevalence in each of the three venues in Japan. Results were fairly consistent across user categories, with no significant differences in workplace  exposure. For restaurants and bars, cigarette smokers and dual users were each more likely to be exposed than non-users ( &lt; 0.05), but not in restaurants. Overall support for complete smoking bans in public places was high in Japan in 2018&#x2014;over three-quarters of respondents supported a total ban on smoking cigarettes in restaurants (78%) and workplaces (81%) and two-thirds supported a ban in bars (65%) (see  &lt; 0.001). This study shows that the lack of strong smoke-free laws in Japan has led to extremely high rates of exposure to deadly  in public places. The findings demonstrate not only that Japan needs to implement a comprehensive smoke-free law without exceptions, but also that the Japanese public&#x2014;including many smokers themselves&#x2014;are supportive of such a law. Evidence from Japan and many other countries shows that partial smoking bans are not effective []. As a result, this study found that smoking and  exposure in these venues was very high&#x2014;especially for bars. Approximately half of all workplaces (49%) and restaurants (55%) and over three-quarters of bars (83%) had smoking in 2018. Another important finding from this study is that overall, the majority of the Japanese public agree that cigarette smoking should be completely banned in public places. As expected, support for complete smoking bans was lowest among cigarette smokers and much higher among non-users, and non-users were also less likely to be exposed to  in public places than tobacco users. However, there were few differences between types of tobacco users (cigarettes, , and dual users) on each of the outcome variables. There is little previous data on  exposure in Japan, but data from 2010 showed that exposure at work among adults (46% of men and 18% of women) was similar to the current findings []. Comparisons with other  Asian countries with a high burden of tobacco use show the need for stronger global efforts to reduce tobacco use and  exposure.  cross-country comparisons using identical survey measures of smoke-free policy evaluation suggest that smoking prevalence in public places in Japan in the current study may be as high or higher than in other Asian countries before the implementation of smoke-free laws [].   Project data also shows that support for smoke-free policies is higher overall in Japan than in other countries. For example, the percentage of Japanese cigarette-only smokers who support smoke-free bars (21%) is higher than the percentage of smokers in Ireland (12%) and France (14%) before those countries implemented their national smoke-free laws [].  This study is the first national evaluation of Japan&#x2019;s lack of comprehensive smoke-free laws on smoking prevalence in public places and support for such laws among a large, nationally representative sample of cigarette smokers,  users, and non-users. While previously published data has also reported on rates of cigarette smoking in indoor public places by smokers themselves []. Further research with additional waves of the  Japan Survey will be conducted to evaluate the more extensive smoke-free laws that will be implemented in April 2020, including any differences in the impact of laws on cigarette smoking compared to  use in public places.  While the findings suggest that public support is not a barrier for smoke-free action, the influence of the tobacco industry in Japan remains an obstacle. For example, Japan Tobacco has a long history of promoting &#x201C;smoking manners&#x201D; to allow smokers and non-smokers to coexist in the absence of strong smoke-free laws []. Although Japan has made recent progress with the passage of new smoke-free legislation since this study was conducted, evidence has shown that only comprehensive laws, along with strong implementation and enforcement, are effective. But even if a more comprehensive law is implemented, the rising use of s in Japan and the promotion of a &#x201C;smoke-free&#x201D; vision by the tobacco industry may increase the challenges of enforcing the law depending on whether s remain subject to the same restrictions. As a Party to the  C, Japan should follow the recommendations of the , which has recently decided that s are tobacco products and are therefore subject to the same provisions of the C as cigarettes, including smoke-free policies []. This study provides baseline evidence that the lack of a comprehensive national smoke-free law in Japan prior to 2018 has resulted in an extremely high prevalence of exposure to deadly  in indoor public places and workplaces. A comprehensive and strongly enforced law in line with the  C Article 8 Guidelines would achieve substantial reductions in  exposure and its resulting harms in Japan, as shown by evidence from other  countries.  While new smoke-free legislation will be implemented in Japan by April 2020, that law will still not be comprehensive. The findings of this study demonstrate that the Japanese public would be supportive not only of a smoke-free Olympics, but also of a complete smoking ban covering all indoor public places without exceptions.

Recent studies have shown that autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for . Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel biomarkers associated with autophagy in . In this study, we downloaded autophagy&#x2010;related genes from Human Autophagy Database (b) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (A) website. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify genes for constructing a risk signature. A nomogram was developed by integrating the risk signature with clinicopathological factors. Time&#x2010;dependent receiver operating characteristic () curve and calibration plot were used to evaluate the efficiency of the prognostic model. Finally, four autophagy&#x2010;related genes (3, 8, K8 and M) were identified and were used for constructing a risk signature, which proved to be an independent risk factor for  patients. Furthermore, a nomogram was developed based on the risk signature and clinicopathological factors (1 status, age and history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy).  curve and calibration plot suggested the nomogram could accurately predict 1&#x2010;, 3&#x2010; and 5&#x2010;year survival rate of  patients. For function analysis, the risk signature was associated with apoptosis, necrosis, immunity, inflammation response and K signalling pathway. In conclusion, the risk signature with 4 autophagy&#x2010;related genes could serve as an independent prognostic factor for  patients. Moreover, we developed a nomogram based on the risk signature and clinical traits which was validated to perform better for predicting 1&#x2010;, 3&#x2010; and 5&#x2010;year survival rate of . Glioblastoma multiforme () is one of the most aggressive types in glioma with 5&#x2010;year survival rate of 5%. It is thus necessary to explore novel biomarkers or targets for  treatment. Recent study has showed that autophagy is involved in tumorigenesis and development of . These researches reveal that autophagy&#x2010;targeted therapy is a promising approach to potentiate the efficacy of conventional therapies in&#xA0;. In this study, we identified four autophagy&#x2010;related genes associated with the prognosis of  patients from the A,  and Gravendeel data sets. A risk signature was established based on the four genes and proved to be an independent risk factor for  patients. Furthermore, we developed a nomogram that integrated the risk signature with clinicopathological factors (1 status, age and experience of radiotherapy or chemotherapy) and validated its better performance for predicting 1&#x2010;, 3&#x2010; and 5&#x2010;year survival rate of  patients. Autophagy&#x2010;related genes were extracted from Human Autophagy Database (b,  In the GlioVis online data set, &#x2010;seq data processing is based on the normalized count reads from the pre&#x2010;processed data (sequence alignment and transcript abundance estimation) with log2 transformation after adding a 0.5 pseudocount. For microarray data, the &#x201C;affy&#x201D; package was used for robust multi&#x2010;array average normalization followed by quantile normalization. To screen genes for constructing risk signature, univariate Cox regression models were performed to select genes that are associated with overall survival of  patients in the A (&#x2010;133A platform),  and Gravendeel data sets.  The  patients were classified into low&#x2010;risk group and high&#x2010;risk group according to the median value of the risk scores. The Kaplan&#x2010;Meier (K&#x2010;M) method and time&#x2010;dependent receiver operating characteristic () curve were used to assess the efficiency of the risk signature. For better clinical application of the risk signature, patients in the A data set (&#x2010;133A) with detailed information about age,  status and experience of radiotherapy or chemotherapy were included. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the association between these factors (risk score, age,  status and history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy) and patients' overall survival.

F, Four genes (3, 8, K8 and M) were selected for constructing a risk signature using multivariate Cox regression model A total of 525  patients in A &#x2010;133A platform were used to establish a risk signature. As mentioned in the method, the risk signature was constructed based on the expression levels of the four genes and the regression coefficient derived from the multivariate Cox regression model. The risk score for each patient was calculated as follows: risk score&#xA0;=&#xA0;(0.1052&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;expression level of 3)&#xA0;+&#xA0;(0.2152&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;expression level of 8)&#xA0;+&#xA0;(&#x2212;0.3603&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;expression level of K8)&#xA0;+&#xA0;(&#x2212;0.2851&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;expression level of M).

The K&#x2010;M survival curves showed that patients with higher risk scores had poorer prognosis than those with lower risk scores (Figure E,F). These results indicated the risk signature performed well for predicting the survival of  patients. Evaluating the efficiencies of the risk signature in the  and Gravendeel data sets. A, B, Kaplan&#x2010;Meier survival curves showed the prognostic value of the risk signature in Gravendeel data set ( low&#x2010;risk group, n&#xA0;=&#xA0;78; high&#x2010;risk group, n&#xA0;=&#xA0;77; &#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;.01). C, D,  curves evaluated the efficiency of the risk signature for predicting 1&#x2010;, 3&#x2010; and 5&#x2010;y survival in Gravendeel data set (C) and  database (D). E, F, The four genes expression profiles, the risk scores distribution and patients' survival status in the Gravendeel data set (E) and  database (F) To explore the association between the risk signature and clinical characteristics, we firstly developed a heatmap to present the distribution trends of age, gender, molecular subtypes, T promoter status&#xA0;and 1 status between low&#x2010;risk and high&#x2010;risk groups in the A database. As shown in Figure &#xA0;=&#xA0;.468). Associations between the signature risk scores and clinical features. A, The heatmap showed the associations between the risk signature and the clinical characteristics (age, gender, molecular subtypes, T promoter status, 1 status and survival status) in the A database. B&#x2010;F, Distribution of the risk scores in different cohorts stratified by the molecular subtype (B, classical, n&#xA0;=&#xA0;144; mesenchymal, n&#xA0;=&#xA0;156; neural, n&#xA0;=&#xA0;88; proneural, n&#xA0;=&#xA0;137; &#xA0;=&#xA0;.469) Afterwards, we also explored the prognostic value of the risk signature in different cohorts stratified by molecular subtypes, T promoter status, 1 status and history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In the four different molecular subtypes, higher risk scores indicated poor prognosis in the mesenchymal (Figure &#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;.0001). Kaplan&#x2010;Meier survival curves showed prognostic values of the risk signature in different cohorts. Prognostic values of the risk signature in different cohorts stratified by mesenchymal and proneural subtypes (A&#x2010;B), 1 wild&#x2010;type (C), T promoter status (D&#x2010;E) and history of radiotherapy (F) or chemotherapy (G) In order to better apply the risk signature, we collected 401  patients in the A &#x2010;133A platform with detailed clinical information including 1 status, age and history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The 401 samples were randomly divided into a training cohort (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;241) and a validation cohort (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;160) (Table I&#x2010;K) for the probabilities of 1&#x2010;, 3&#x2010; and 5&#x2010;year survival. These results indicated that the nomogram demonstrated good accuracy for predicting 1&#x2010;, 3&#x2010; and 5&#x2010;year survival rates of  patients.

As shown in Figure D). In this pathway map, a majority of red&#x2010;labelled genes were involved in triggering K signalling pathway that can induce cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, cell cycle and apoptosis. In brief, these results revealed that the risk signature was correlated with apoptosis, necrosis, immunity and inflammation response and K signalling pathway. Functional roles of the risk signature.

Emerging evidence has indicated that autophagy plays essential roles in  and serves as a therapeutic target. The level of autophagy in  is declined, Despite the controversial roles of autophagy in , these investigations suggest autophagy is a promising target for  treatment and needs further explorations. In our study, we identified four autophagy&#x2010;related genes (3, 8, K8 and M) which were associated with  survival.  family ase 3 (3), also known as I, is a member of  superfamily and locates on human chromosome 1p31. Its encoding protein shares 60% homology with  or Rap, but unlike other members, it has a long N&#x2010;terminal extension, low ase activity and constitutive  binding state in resting cells. The research on M in  has not been reported yet, and it needs to be further explored. Previously, there was a report about an autophagy&#x2010;related gene signature in glioma. Therefore, more samples with detailed clinical information will be collected to make up for these shortcomings and assess the efficiency of the nomogram in future study. In summary, our study identified four autophagy&#x2010;related genes that were associated with  survival. Based on the four genes, a risk signature was established and proved to be an independent prognostic factor for  patients. On molecular function, the risk signature was found to be correlated with apoptosis, necrosis, immunity and inflammation response and K signalling pathway. Furthermore, we developed a nomogram integrating the risk signature with several clinicopathological factors (1 status, age and experience of radiotherapy or chemotherapy), which was validated to perform better for predicting 1&#x2010;, 3&#x2010; and 5&#x2010;year survival.

Blood samples, collected at surgery, were used for cell-free  (cf) and circulating tumor cell () analyses. Finally, personalized therapies were tested in patient-derived xenografts (s) generated from the s.  analyses revealed the presence of genetic alterations in 93% of the tumors. Circulating tumor  (ct) was present in 41.2% of cases, mainly in patients with high-risk tumors, thus indicating a clear association with a more aggressive disease. Accordingly, the results obtained during the post-surgery follow-up indicated the presence of ct in three patients with progressive disease. Moreover, 38.9% of patients were positive for s at surgery. Finally, the efficacy of targeted therapies based on the -specific mutational landscape was demonstrated in  models.

Informed consent forms, approved by the pertinent ethical committees, were signed by all patients (Autonomic Galician Ethical Committee Code 2017/430, approval number 276&#x2013;2018 of the Vall d&#x2019;Hebron Ethical Committee). s were obtained at surgery with a Cornier cannula and kept on ice until they were processed, always within 1 hour. Each  was then homogenized with phosphate-buffered saline () at a 1:1 ratio and centrifuged at 4 &#xB0;C for 20 min at 2500 &#xD7;  to remove remaining cells. Plasma supernatants were stored at &#x2212;80 &#xB0;C until use. The fraction containing the mononuclear cells obtained after the first centrifugation was used for  isolation with the CellSearch system (Menarini, Sylicon Biosystems, Bologna, Italy). This system allows for the isolation and enumeration of Ep-positive s. After  isolation with the CellSearch Epithelial Circulating Tumor Cell Kit (Menarini, Silicon Biosystems Inc), cells were labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-cytokeratin () antibodies, allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-45 antibodies, and 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (I) to stain the nuclei (). The CellTracks Analyzer (Menarini, Silicon Biosystems, Bologna, Italy) was used to acquire digital images of the three different fluorescent dyes with a 12-bit camera; the images were reviewed by trained operators to determine the  count.  extraction from cells present in the pellet, obtained after  processing, was performed with the Mag). Targeted sequencing of  was performed with the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel v3 (Thermo Fisher, Pleasanton, , ), and personalized therapies identified through an in silico study using various compound databases are detailed below. To prepare amplicon libraries, we performed targeted sequencing of uterine multiplex  with the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0 and Oncomine Comprehensive Panel v3 (Thermo Fisher, Pleasanton, , ). For , a total of 17 and 20 cycles were performed. The  template preparation and enrichment were performed with the Ion  Template 2 200 Kit and Ion OneTouch 2 System. Finally, the Ion  Sequencing 200 Kit v2 and Ion  System (Life Technologies, Santa Clara, , ) were used for  sequencing, according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocols. Duplicates were analyzed for 10% of the samples and found to yield equivalent results. For the bioinformatics analysis, alignment to the Hg19 human reference genome and variant calling were performed with Torrent Suite&#x2122; Software v.4.2.1 (Life Technologies, Santa Clara, , ). All samples were sequenced and analyzed in comparable conditions. The mean coverage per sequenced sample was approximately 1500 reads per base. Variants with a Phred quality score field value less than 100 were considered as low-quality variants. The prediction of genomic variant effects on protein function was performed with the N Genome Variants tool (). To identify potential effective drugs on the basis of the mutational profile obtained from the targeted sequencing analysis, we performed an in silico study using the  () compound databases. These databases contain peer-reviewed information about the effect of particular drugs on specific genes or signaling pathways, thus indicating the relationship between chemicals and proteins in the human context. In this analysis, we included the mutational status of each identified gene per case. The identified drugs were then used to treat  models, and standard protocol treatment was included as a control. For each patient, specific dd assays were designed and run on a -200 d system (Bio-Rad, California, ) using TaqMan chemistry, with primers and probes at final concentrations of 900 nM and 250 nM, respectively. For each patient-specific assay, one non-target control, one wild-type control (fragmented genomic  from a healthy donor), and one positive control (patient  ) were used. Custom TaqMan assays were used (Bio-Rad, , ) according to the variants discovered from tumor tissue sequencing. The linearity and the lower limit of detection () for all dd assays used in the study were tested with dilutions of synthetic targeted sequences in a background of 20,000 copies of wild type ()  (mutant copies ranging from 0 to 40). All assays were run in triplicates and to assure their performance, the Pearson correlation between the estimated and experimental mutant copies detected was calculated (Pearson r = 0.995) ().  was performed with the dd Supermix for probes (Bio-Rad, Santa Rosa, , ) and partitioned into a median of 50,000 droplets per sample (run in triplicates) in an automated droplet generator (Bio-Rad, , ), according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Emulsified  reactions were run on 96-well plates on a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, , ) by incubating the plates at 95 &#xB0;C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 &#xB0;C for 15 sec; the specific assay extension temperature for 60 sec; and 98 &#xB0;C for 10 min. The temperature ramp increment was 2.5 &#xB0;C/sec for all steps. Plates were read on a Bio-Rad -200 droplet reader with Bio-Rad&#x2019;s QuantaSoft v1.7.4 software to quantify the number of droplets positive for mutant , wild-type , both, or neither. A minimum of 30,000 positive droplets across wells were required for a valid assay, and a minimum of five, single -positive droplets with no positive events were required for the  control. The  was mechanically disaggregated with the  Pellet Mixer ( International, Radnor, , ) and through a 30 G needle. Fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, , ) was added to facilitate disaggregation. A Matrigel matrix ( Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, , ) was added in a 1:2 ratio and kept on ice until use. Then, 50 &#xB5;L of this mix was injected into the uteri of 8-week-old female D-beige mice (Janvier Labs; Le Genest Saint-Isle, France). For implantation of the processed , mice were housed and maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions, and procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and approved by the Use Committee for Animal Care from the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela. Aseptic procedures were followed for all surgeries. Each 8-week-old female D-beige mouse (Janvier Labs, Le Genest Saint-Isle, France) was anesthetized with 2% isoflurane/air (Isoflo, Esteve Farma, Carnaxide, Portugal) and kept under anesthesia for the entire procedure. The area was prepared for sterile surgery by shaving off the fur and scrubbing with a betadine solution and sterile 4&#xD7;4 gauze. A midline ventral incision was made in the skin and abdominal wall. Once open, the uterus was located and 50 &#xB5;L of cell suspension ( cell suspension in the Matrigel matrix ( Biosciences) in a 1:2 ratio) was injected with a 30 G syringe. After the Matrigel was allowed to solidify, the syringe was removed and the uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity. The wound was closed with Ethicon  (Johnson &amp; Johnson International, Diegem, Belgium) sutures. Buprenodale (Dechra, Dales Pharmaceuticals, Keighley Road, Skipton, ) was used for postoperative analgesia. The orthotopic tumors that developed in the uteri were minced into small pieces and placed subcutaneously in the flanks of 8-week-old female D-beige mice ( &#xD7; L)/2 where V is the tumor volume, W is the tumor width, and L is the tumor length. Statistical analyses were performed in  S Statistics 20, and graphs were generated in GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, , ). Two-tailed Mann&#x2013;Whitney U test or Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test was used to evaluate the differential cf, ct, and  levels among clinical groups. The Pearson correlation test was performed to determine the relationship between quantitative experimental and clinical variables. Associations between clinicopathologic features and the presence of ct or s were examined with the chi-square test (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test). A -value &lt; 0.05 was set as the level of statistical significance. Sixty patients who were diagnosed with  and had to undergo surgery were included in the study. The clinicopathologic information (]. Targeted sequencing of the s from each of the 60 recruited patients was performed with the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel v3, as indicated in the Materials and Methods section. This panel included 87 hotspot regions, 48 full-length genes, 43 copy number regions in specific genes, and 188 gene fusions for 51 genes, all of which are frequently mutated in cancer. Indeed, most of these genetic and genomic regions have been observed to be altered in  [ = 2). After the tumor mutational landscape was analyzed in s, we assessed the cf cargo and patient-specific mutations in the ct of each patient. The cf concentration and quality were evaluated with Qubit fluorometry and TapeStation technology (A). Together, these results indicated increased  release into the circulation in patients with aggressive high-risk endometrial tumors. We next used dd analysis of the isolated cf to explore the presence of the patient-specific mutations previously identified in the s. Briefly, for each patient, we selected the mutations found at higher frequency on the basis of the  study of s, and we validated the corresponding dd assays for the detection of low mutant allele frequency (). The  for point mutations ranged from 0.1% to 0.03%, whereas for s, the general  varied from 8% to 20% (depending on the copy number identified in the s) (). When disaggregated according to risk of recurrence and type I and type  , mainly high-risk s (68.7%; 11 of 16) were found to be positive for ct, whereas Cs (43.75%; 7 of 16) and low/intermediate-risk endometrioid carcinomas (15.8%; 3 of 19) were found to be positive for ct. More interestingly, significantly higher positivity rates for ct were associated with higher levels of cf, suggesting a higher sensitivity of the dd-based assay in this group of patients (). We then analyzed the  population in a subset of patients by using the reference technology for  enumeration (CellSearch technology). Thirty-six patients (25 high-risk and 11 low/intermediate-risk patients) were analyzed, including cases of both  (n = 23) and C (n = 13), as detailed in C,D). These results confirmed the additional value of  detection for risk evaluation, and the complementary ability of ct and  analyses to provide a global overview of all risk factors influencing patients&#x2019; disease evolution after surgery. We completed a personalized pipeline to improve  clinical management by exploring the clinical utility of s for the selection and validation of targeted therapies in  For this purpose, we exploited the value of the  as a liquid biopsy to characterize the overall mutational landscape of  together with its potential as a tool to develop  models, which recapitulate the heterogeneity of primary tumors. Through this procedure, we selected Patient #24, diagnosed with serous C and presenting with ct at the time of surgery and recurrent disease 12 months after debulking surgery, with elevated levels of ct (C). As shown in D). Patients normally have good prognosis if diagnosis occurs in early stages of  However, some patients experience recurrence after surgery, and this recurrence is not predictable with the current risk classification systems. Clinical management of the risk of recurrence remains an unsolved issue that is probably associated with tumor heterogeneity and early tumor dissemination []. Our study performed the first combined characterization of s, ct, and s to comprehensively explore the value of liquid biopsies for personalizing  treatment. To do so, we determined the genomic landscape of  samples obtained at surgery in a relevant cohort of patients. The samples recapitulated the mutational patterns found in tissue samples from s and had the additional advantages of being minimally invasive and representative of the molecular heterogeneity of primary carcinomas. We were able to detect genetic alterations in 93% of the  samples analyzed with targeted sequencing. ] regarding the use of sequencing analysis of s to capture  as an alternative diagnostic biopsy to aid in the selection of more specific treatments. In addition to providing a valuable tool to better understand the biology of each endometrial tumor, the characterization of s also facilitated the translation of a personalized approach to relevant clinical blood samples through the analysis of patient-specific mutations with cf. The levels of cf in  have been studied []. In our study, including both endometrioid and non-endometrioid tumors, cf levels at surgery were significantly higher in high-risk tumors. Therefore, cf levels have potential as a prognostic factor, although long-term follow-up of patients will be required to definitively demonstrate the clinical value. Importantly, the rate of positive cases for ct at surgery was 41.2%, and this rate was higher in high-risk tumors. Even though these tumors were not characterized for their  release and not all mutations found in  sequencing were followed by dd, the detection rate presented in this article with our targeted approach was higher than that previously described with other technologies, such as  [].  enumeration showed similar, but slightly higher, rates of positivity than that reported in previous studies in  analyzed with the CellSearch system (probably associated with the specific characteristics of the different cohorts) []. Finally, our study also pioneered the use of s in selecting targeted therapies based on the patient-specific genomic landscape, and generating  models as an individualized approach to evaluate their efficacy. We were able to generate  models closely resembling the patient tumor characteristics and reproducing the molecular and histologic features. The preclinical study targeting the identified 3-activating alteration confirmed the activity of 719 (a specific 3 inhibitor) and demonstrated the clinical value of our personalized pipeline based on liquid biopsies to address therapeutic alternatives. In conclusion, the global liquid biopsy strategy presented in this work, in which sequencing of s from individual patients with  was complemented by cf, ct, and  analyses, confirmed the clinical utility of the management of patients with , including an accurate risk classification and the potential selection of more personalized therapies. This non-invasive approach clearly provides a valuable tool for precision medicine in  and can probably be extended to other gynecologic tumors.

Novel strategies are needed to address vaccine hesitancy (), which correlates with complementary and alternative medicine (). In Switzerland,  providers play important roles in vaccine counseling of vaccine hesitant () parents, and traditional vaccination messaging tends to overlook  provider perspectives. In the setting of a Swiss national research program on , our key strategy has been to work together closely with  providers. To assess the feasibility of generating educational human papillomavirus () vaccine materials that would interest  healthcare providers (s), we invited four  providers to co-author two  vaccine review articles for general practitioners. We conducted thematic analysis of  provider comments to identify patterns that could complement and improve vaccination messaging from  perspectives. We identified several themes and generated an inventory of  provider messaging recommendations related to language use, presentation of background information, nuanced statements regarding  vaccine efficacy and safety, and communication tools that would be important to  s. Contrary to our initial expectations, and in an inclusive, respectful atmosphere of open dialogue, we were able to productively finalize our manuscripts. In the opinion of the  co-authors, the manuscripts effectively considered the communication needs and perspectives of  s. Engaging with  providers appears to be a feasible and innovative avenue for providing vaccine information and designing communication tools aimed at  healthcare providers. In 2019, the World Health Organization () listed vaccine hesitancy () as one of 10 major threats to global health []. In response to the &#x2019;s announcement about the &#x201C;threat&#x201D; of , strategies to address  are urgently needed. Studies show a complex association between complementary and alternative medicine () use and  []. Not only patients are vaccine hesitant; evidence now suggests the need to address  among healthcare providers (s) []. Based on repeated suggestions to us by Swiss  providers that  s are unlikely to even read review articles that employ the traditional communication approach that vaccines are safe and effective, we tested a strategy of listening to  providers&#x2019; perspectives and including them as co-authors in our review articles and communication tools for  vaccines. To our knowledge,  providers, who play an important role in vaccination counseling in Switzerland, have previously not been involved in similar collaborations. We hypothesized that, in order to reach  s, it is important to use nuanced language that considers particular vaccine concerns and communication needs. The endpoint of our collaboration was therefore to write  vaccine review articles together with  doctors so that  s would actually read them. Here we investigate whether an innovative approach to engaging with  providers is feasible and productive. The objective of this article is to provide detailed characterizations of the insights and lessons we learned from including four Swiss  doctor comments, with two as co-authors, in two  vaccine review articles [] written for Swiss general practitioners (both articles originally in German, one translated to French). Overall, our findings suggest that including  providers in the collaborative writing of vaccine review articles is a feasible, productive, and potentially promising approach to design communication tools for clinical practice in order to address  In Switzerland,  use is prevalent among 25%&#x2013;50% of the population []. The same study found that 97% of pediatrician respondents reported patients and parents inquiring about , 65% were interested in pursuing  training, 16% provided  to their patients, and more than 50% used  for themselves or their families. Despite vaccination being on a voluntary basis and the popularity of  in the Swiss context, vaccination rates for childhood vaccinations are overall relatively high for most routine childhood vaccinations (i.e., 87%&#x2013;93% nationally for 2 doses of mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine for 2-, 8-, and 16-year-olds) []. We incorporated 4 trained  doctors&#x2019; comments and suggestions and included 2 of them as co-authors on 2  vaccine review articles and communication tools that we wrote for general practitioners () in Switzerland as the target audience []. In order to provide an inside look into the discussions with our  doctor co-authors, we assembled their suggestions and have subjected their comments to ] to structure our analyses and used  software to code and organize our data into meaningful themes. The 4 reviewing  doctors included 2 pediatricians specialized in anthroposophic medicine, a general practitioner () specialized in homeopathy, and a  of integrative family medicine. We did not assume that they provided suggestions representative of   providers, but we included their contributions with the hypothesis that university researchers and public health authorities could learn from  provider&#x2019;s experiences and perspectives when generating medical review articles and communication tools and vice versa. Of note, . is a chief of pediatrics of the most renowned Swiss hospital specializing in anthroposophic medicine, . is a chief of the first center for integrative pediatrics at a Swiss public hospital, . is an influential private family medicine practitioner, and . is president of the Swiss association of homeopathic physicians and of  of associations of Swiss physicians of complementary medicine. Through analysis of four  doctor recommendations for two manuscripts, we identified several patterns, which allowed us to group data into five overarching themes related to language and terminology,  vaccine efficacy, safety, communication tools for clinical consultation, and other important points deserving elaboration. The themes are presented in detail in the Tables where we display the specific content of  doctor recommendations, how we coded various sub-themes, and if we included their recommendations in the final manuscripts. An overarching criticism was that the manuscripts appeared to be peddling pro-vaccination &#x201C;propaganda&#x201D;, which the  doctors argued would be unacceptable for  s. They hypothesized that prominent statements such as &#x201C; vaccine is safe and effective&#x201D;, which already regularly appear in literature published by public health authorities and in medical guidelines [], would lead  s to not even read the manuscripts. They recommended that we opt for nuances such as the vaccine &#x201C;is considered&#x201D; to be safe and effective. Other linguistic nuances included statements that were presented as proven facts, whereas there might be underlying uncertainty; they recommended we state, &#x201C;most experts agree&#x201D;, rather than &#x201C;experts agree&#x201D;. We did not follow recommendations to remove two statements that  doctors considered to be &#x201C;pro-vaccine propaganda&#x201D;, related to vaccine efficacy in reducing genital warts, and waiting to vaccinate until 2020 until data on vaccine efficacy in preventing cervical cancer would be available. All agreed to underline that  vaccine today is well documented to reduce the incidence of cervical dysplasia (). The  doctors recommended we refine our discussion by highlighting that projections regarding vaccine efficacy to protect against anal and orophyngeal cancers were hypothetical at the time the articles were written in late 2017. Another item had to do with natural vs. vaccine-induced antibodies. They indicated that  providers are generally highly interested in the body&#x2019;s ability to remove  and heal dysplasia after  acquisition by naturally induced immune responses. The  doctors agreed that vaccination induces -specific antibodies much more reliably and at higher serum concentrations compared to natural infection, this being a salient argument in favor of  vaccine ().  doctors pointed out that our manuscripts unnecessary highlighted the local adverse reactions to the  vaccine. They encouraged us to instead focus on -vaccine specific safety issues, such as case reports of rare but serious illnesses following vaccination, without inciting fear. While commending our emphasis on large-scale epidemiological evidence, acknowledging such case reports, they argued, would appeal to the tendency of  providers to incorporate &#x201C;experiential&#x201D; knowledge and anecdotal evidence into their medical practices [).  doctors suggested we &#x201C;inform patients about&#x201D;, as opposed to &#x201C;recommending&#x201D;  vaccine. They also suggested that we prominently state that all vaccines remain voluntary in Switzerland and that trusting relationships can exist between patients and physicians regardless of patient vaccination decisions. Finally, they recommended that all patients be explicitly invited to voice concerns and ask questions about  vaccine, similar to informed consent prior to any operative procedure, even patients who state they wish to be vaccinated. While  doctors pointed to how physicians can feel uneasy when broaching sexual matters, particularly with younger adolescents, they suggested we should not &#x201C;de-sexualize&#x201D;  vaccine. We did not follow their suggestions to include the possibility of waiting to vaccinate adolescents until age 15&#x2013;16 years (when they would be more amenable to informed  vaccine discussions and decisions), which would not adhere to official recommendations to vaccinate at age 11&#x2013;14 years, prior to adolescents becoming sexually active. Similarly, we did not include the suggested possibility of administering  and hepatitis B vaccines at separate times so as to attribute potential adverse effects to each individual vaccine (). The following points seemed particularly pertinent because they drew our attention to items that might appeal to all readers, not just  s. For example,  doctors&#x2019; comments called our attention to the value of explicitly describing the sequence of events following natural  infection in order to help build a case for the importance of primary prevention against initial  infection via vaccine. Since  is typically vaccine-specific, they encouraged us to provide more specific information on  infection before discussing  vaccine, that we elaborate on  vaccination for young men (since the recent recommendation to vaccinate boys and young men were likely not yet well known), and that we mention the cost of  vaccine, including how Swiss vaccination programs are funded, and that  vaccines are more expensive than other vaccines, and therefore likely lucrative for pharmaceutical companies. Finally, they agreed on mentioning  herd immunity thresholds in order to underscore the vaccine&#x2019;s public health relevance (). Our collaboration with six -oriented physicians has shown three main results. First, the process of generating  vaccine review articles and communication tools in collaboration with  providers appears feasible and may represent an important novel approach to better addressing  Second, we have generated an inventory of  vaccine messaging recommendations that are likely, according to four  doctors, to be relevant and palatable to  s but that may improve vaccine counseling by all s. As shown in the results section, the messaging recommendations that would likely appeal to  s and  provider audiences dealt with being sensitive to language use, particularly language perceived as overtly and uncritically &#x201C;pro-vaccine&#x201D;, precisions about safety and efficacy data, emphasizing vaccination as a choice in clinical communication, and the inclusion of detailed information about  infections and  vaccine specific information. ]. Our collaborative approach is, to our knowledge, a first attempt of taking a -inclusive rather than -exclusive vaccine messaging approach. This may seem self-evident, but it goes beyond traditional top-down, knowledge deficit model efforts by (1) actively including  s in the target audience for  review articles, (2) listening to and engaging relevant stakeholders, (3) trying to understand the needs of the   audience, (4) targeting communication to those needs, and (5) designing culturally targeted interventions [], and that nuanced language choice can both empower and stigmatize in the oft-polarized discussions around vaccination, will be important for establishing meaningful dialogue in future efforts to address  The aim of our collaboration with four  doctors in the design of  vaccine review articles and communication tools [] recently echoed these statements in response to the recent global measles resurgence: &#x201C;New tools are needed for physicians and healthcare providers to reverse this trend and regain our role as patient&#x2019;s best advocates&#x201D;. In our view, our review articles clearly benefited from  doctors&#x2019; emphasis on patient-oriented medicine and from their focus on building trusting relationships with patients and families, which have been shown as important considerations for  patients. The work presented here suggests the feasibility of collaborative approaches that engage  providers, and we recommend such innovation to other researchers and for other health care issue and communication settings. For example, based on our productive cooperation, our research team is now conducting focus group discussions with  and biomedical providers in order to design vaccination communication interventions. We have now also successfully collaborated with the same  providers on other topics during the preparation of review articles for Swiss s aiming at reducing antibiotic overuse in the setting of acute respiratory infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria and cystitis. On a larger scale, our ongoing National Research Program on vaccine hesitancy [], the incorporation of  perspectives and engagement with practitioners of both  and biomedicine into vaccination communication strategies is, in our view, a feasible, innovative, and reasonable approach to addressing  in the Swiss context. Our work has limitations. Even though the four collaborating  doctors were prominent  practitioners in their fields, they could not possibly represent the perspectives of all  providers in Switzerland, in particular the most hesitant providers. Rather, we took their recommendations by considering them as a sounding board for the creation of messaging that they felt would overcome the initial hurdle of rejection by  s and also gain traction within their various networks of  providers. However, we do not have data about the overall impact of the two  vaccine review articles among s, nor do we have data about their influence on  among s. Such measurements go beyond the scope of this article. Additionally, we did not integrate all  doctor suggestions into the final manuscripts in an &#x2018;anything goes&#x2019; approach. Final decisions were negotiated internally with the conditions that we stay within the realms of evidence-based medicine, we adhere to official  vaccine guidelines, and that we make note of the quality of available evidence we presented in the final articles. This was possible in the vast majority of instances. In this article, we show that our approach to engaging with  providers is feasible and productive. We have provided an inside look into an innovative approach for drafting  vaccine review articles and communication tools which seem relevant to all providers, including potentially  s. Using nuanced communication suggested to us by four  doctors, we were able to develop an intervention approach with the explicit goal of addressing  among physicians and patients by improving the factual and communicative quality of  vaccine information. By inviting  doctors as co-authors, we sent a symbolically strong message to practitioners of  in Switzerland, indicating that we recognize their important clinical and public health role in providing vaccine counseling, particularly to  individuals []. Addressing  in clinical practice can, and should, benefit from multiple perspectives and involve all culturally relevant and appropriate stakeholders while informing medical review articles and communication tools for s.

However, the ecological disturbances and changes in patterns of trade associated with the development of shrimp farming have presented many of the pre&#x2010;conditions for the emergence and spread of disease. Shrimp are displaced from their natural environments, provided artificial or alternative feeds, stocked in high density, exposed to stress through changes in water quality and are transported nationally and internationally, either live or as frozen product. These practices have provided opportunities for increased pathogenicity of existing infections, exposure to new pathogens, and the rapid transmission and transboundary spread of disease. Not surprisingly, a succession of new viral diseases has devastated the production and livelihoods of farmers and their sustaining communities. This review examines the major viral pathogens of farmed shrimp, the likely reasons for their emergence and spread, and the consequences for the structure and operation of the shrimp farming industry. In addition, this review discusses the health management strategies that have been introduced to combat the major pathogens and the reasons that disease continues to have an impact, particularly on poor, small&#x2010;holder farmers in Asia. Over the past three decades, shrimp farming in Asia has expanded rapidly from a very low base of traditional, low&#x2010;density polyculture to become a vibrant export industry currently valued at more than $8 billion (). Although there has been a marked recovery in recent years, disease remains a major concern for the sustainability and profitability of the industry. This review will discuss the nature of these viral pathogens, the likely reasons for their emergence and spread, and the consequences of pandemic disease, both good and bad, for the structure and operation of the shrimp farming industry. The review will also discuss health management strategies that have been introduced to combat the major pathogens and the reasons that disease continues to have an impact, particularly on poor, small&#x2010;holder farmers in Asia. &#x2002;History of the emergence of the major pathogens of farmed shrimp. , gill&#x2010;associated virus; , infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus; V, infectious myonecrosis virus; , monodon baculovirus; S, monodon slow growth syndrome; , Taura syndrome virus; V, white spot syndrome virus; , yellow head virus. More than 20 viruses have been reported to infect marine shrimp. Many have not been associated with clinical signs of disease and some have been observed only by electron microscopy and are poorly characterised (). By international agreement, diseases listed by the  should be reported by member countries and are subject to specified health measures that are intended to limit disease spread and assure sanitary safety of international trade in aquatic animals and their products. Six of the seven &#x2010;listed marine shrimp viruses have been reported to occur in Asia. &#x2002;Major viruses infecting marine shrimp &#x2020; listed. &#x2021;International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. White spot syndrome virus (V) is by far the most devastating pathogen of farmed shrimp. It infects all cultured penaeids and has been responsible for much of the economic impact of disease on production globally. White spot disease () was first reported in June 1992 in cultured kuruma shrimp (). It is now enzootic in all shrimp&#x2010;farming regions throughout much of Central and South America. The original source of emergence of V in East Asia is not known, but it does not appear to be a natural shrimp pathogen and may have been introduced to shrimp broodstock via an unusual source of live or frozen feed. White spot disease commonly results in 80&#x2013;100% mortality within 5&#x2013;10&#x2003;days of the first appearance of clinical signs (). White spot syndrome virus is a large, ovaloid,  virus (120&#x2013;150&#x2003;nm&#x2003;&#xD7;&#x2003;270&#x2013;290&#x2003;nm) with a lipid envelope that features an unusual tail&#x2010;like appendage (). The &#x223C;305&#x2003;kbp V genome encodes &#x223C;180 long, open reading frames () and nine homologous regions containing direct repeats, inverted repeats and palindromes (). White spot syndrome virus has a very broad host range in decapod crustaceans. In marine shrimp, the virus occurs commonly as a low&#x2010;level persistent infection in the absence of clinical signs, but rapid increases in viral load, precipitated by physiological stress, salinity change or lower temperatures, can lead to disease and mass mortalities in ponds (). White spot syndrome virus infection can be transmitted either horizontally or vertically. Horizontal infection of shrimp and other crustaceans has been demonstrated experimentally by exposure to infected water or by ingestion of infected tissue (). Both horizontal and vertical transmission of V infection can occur in the absence of disease. Yellow head disease was first reported in farmed black tiger shrimp (). Yellow head disease affects shrimp in early to late juvenile stages and is characterised by rapid feed consumption followed by a cessation of feeding and the congregation of disoriented and moribund shrimp at the pond edge, with rapidly accelerating mortalities. The disease derives its name from the bleached or pale&#x2010;yellow appearance of the cephalothorax, resulting from discolouration of the underlying hepatopancreas, but this condition is not always apparent (). The  is a rod&#x2010;shaped, enveloped positive&#x2010;sense single&#x2010;stranded  (ss) virus (40&#x2013;60&#x2003;nm&#x2003;&#xD7;&#x223C;150&#x2013;200&#x2003;nm) with a helical nucleocapsid and prominent knob&#x2010;like surface projections (). Glycoprotein gp116 must perform a critical function in viral infection, but the domain structure has not been defined and the role of gp64 is presently unexplored. There is also evidence that a small triple&#x2010;membrane&#x2010;spanning protein (gp22) is a very minor component of  virions (Nusra Sittidilokratna and Peter Walker, unpublished data, 2007). The 26&#x2003;662&#x2003;nt  genome is polyadenylated and contains four long  (). The 26&#x2003;235&#x2003;nt  genome is very similar in organisation to that of , but there is some evidence that 4 (which is somewhat longer than the 4 in ) may be functional (Cowley &amp; Walker ). Although yellow head disease outbreaks have been reported only in  populations throughout the Indo&#x2010;Pacific region. Yellow head virus and  can be transmitted horizontally by injection, immersion or ingestion of infected shrimp tissue and by co&#x2010;habitation with infected shrimp () ensures that the threshold of infection required for disease is far more easily obtained (Nusra Sittidilokratna and Peter Walker, unpublished data, 2008). Taura syndrome first emerged in farmed white Pacific shrimp (). The impact in Asia is yet to be systematically evaluated. The original source of  in Ecuador is unknown, but its apparent absence prior to 1992 and the radiant nature of its spread indicate that it is unlikely to be a natural infection of shrimp. Taura syndrome virus may well have crossed species from another invertebrate host in the farming environment. Taura syndrome usually occurs in juvenile ). Taura syndrome virus is a small, non&#x2010;enveloped, positive&#x2010;sense ss virus with icosahedral architecture (31&#x2013;32&#x2003;nm diameter). It is similar to small insect viruses in the genus ). Although ). Taura syndrome virus can be transmitted horizontally by injection, ingestion of infected tissue or exposure to infected shrimp or shrimp carcasses (). Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis (N) first emerged in mid&#x2010;1981 as a viral disease causing mass mortalities (&gt;90%) in juvenile and sub&#x2010;adult ). Following the initial detection in Hawaii,  was found to be widely distributed in ). Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus is a small (22&#x2003;nm), non&#x2010;enveloped  virus with icosahedral symmetry (). Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus can be transmitted horizontally by injection, ingestion or exposure to infected water (). Infectious myonecrosis () is the most recently emergent of the major viral diseases of shrimp. It was first recognised in September 2002 in farmed  farming regions in south and north&#x2010;east Sumatra (Ketut Sugama, pers. comm., 2007). Infectious myonecrosis virus is a small (40&#x2003;nm) non&#x2010;enveloped, non&#x2010;segmented double&#x2010;stranded  (ds) virus with icolahedral symmetry (). Experimental infection studies have demonstrated that ). There is currently little other published information on the biology of V infection. Monodon baculovirus (), also called spherical baculovirus, was first observed in 1977 in adult  have relied primarily on histology, electron microscopy and/or positive  reactions. A more detailed molecular analysis, together with bioassays, should be conducted to establish with more confidence the susceptible host range of . Monodon baculovirus can cause high mortalities in larvae (protozoea and mysis) and early postlarval stages (). Monodon baculovirus is a large, bacilliform ds virus that is classified as the tentative species Penaeus monodon nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Pemo) in the genus ). There are no published data available on the polypeptide composition of  virions or on the molecular characterisation of the viral . Monodon baculovirus can be transmitted by co&#x2010;habitation, feeding or exposure to homogenates of infected tissue (). The emergence and spread of new or previously quiescent viral diseases is an increasingly common phenomenon that has drawn serious attention in recent years. Much of this interest has been stimulated by the emergence of a range of human diseases of animal origin, such as &#x2010;S, Ebola and S, and recognition of the alarming prospect that human&#x2010;to&#x2010;human transmission of avian influenza could precipitate a devastating global pandemic (). Viruses are obligate parasites that normally exist in a biological cycle that involves a stable ecological association with one or more hosts (). New diseases usually emerge as a consequence of a major shift in the environment of the virus that upsets this natural balance and leads to significant changes in the biology of infection (). There are two fundamentally different mechanisms by which new infectious diseases may emerge as a result of ecological imbalance. The first involves viruses (or other micro&#x2010;organisms) that have a natural association with a particular host, but do not normally cause disease. Through a shift in the natural ecological balance, a normally benign agent may become pathogenic in its natural host. Factors with the potential to cause such an imbalance include immunosuppression or reduced resistance to disease (induced by environmental stressors, chemicals, radiation or other infections), enhanced replication (induced by a shift in ambient temperature) or modified cell tropism (induced by a different route of exposure). The second mechanism involves a more dramatic change in viral ecology associated with cross&#x2010;species transmission. This complex process, by which a virus establishes in a new host, comprises four stages: (i) contact between a pathogen and a new, potentially susceptible host; (ii) transmission to and replication of the pathogen in the new host; (iii) sustained transmission of the pathogen between individuals of the new host; and (iv) genetic adaptation of the pathogen to achieve a new ecological balance in the new host (). Shrimp aquaculture is an important seafood industry that has created new employment and contributed significantly to socio&#x2010;economic development in many countries in Asia and the Americas. However, large&#x2010;scale shrimp aquaculture also represents a change in human activity with the potential for very significant impacts on the environment and the ecology of pathogens. The displacement of shrimp from their natural offshore or estuarine environments to terrestrial, earthen ponds provides opportunities for exposure to pathogens that they may not naturally encounter. The use of artificial or alternative live feeds presents risks of inadvertent cross&#x2010;species transmission of contaminating pathogens. The culture conditions can often be stressful, particularly when water quality is poor or variable, compromising the natural defences of the shrimp and their capacity to contain infection. High stocking densities facilitate rapid transmission of infection and disease (). The emergence and spread of a growing array of shrimp diseases is a natural and predictable consequence of these practices. Shrimp pathogens can be considered to fall into two categories: (i) those for which shrimp are the natural host in which they have existed in for, perhaps, millions of years; and (ii) those that have been introduced to shrimp as a result of a recent cross&#x2010;species transmission. Of the major viral pathogens of marine shrimp, V,  and V have almost certainly emerged through cross&#x2010;species transmission. Each of these viral pathogens appears to have spread from a single focal origin in Asia or South America and had not been detected in farmed or wild shrimp prior to disease emergence. Each also appears to represent a single evolving genetic lineage that reflects its focal origin. However, neither the original sources of infection nor the mechanism of first exposure have been determined conclusively for these important pathogens. White spot syndrome virus has a very broad susceptible host range in decapod crustaceans and is now detected commonly in wild shrimp and crabs in many locations where shrimp are farmed. However, reports of V in crustaceans outside of shrimp&#x2010;farming regions are rare and the virus has not been detected in surveys of crustaceans in Australia where there is no V or  in farmed shrimp (). The mechanism of yellow head disease emergence in farmed shrimp is less clear. Like V,  was not known prior to its appearance in Thailand in 1990 ( as a result of cross&#x2010;species transmission from another similar shrimp species, perhaps a metapenaeid, in which it does not cause disease. If so, the natural host may be an important reservoir of  infection and a continuing source of spill&#x2010;over into farmed shrimp. Further investigation of the genetic basis of virulence and the susceptibility of other shrimp species may unravel the obscure origins of yellow head disease. Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus is almost certainly a natural inhabitant of ). Shrimp viruses usually cause low&#x2010;level unapparent infections in their natural host and are commonly transmitted vertically. Disease emergence is usually the result of stress, high stocking density or other aspects of the culture system that disturb the natural cycle of infection. Aquaculture practices provide abundant opportunities for the emergence and spread of disease and it is highly likely that new diseases will continue to emerge with significant impacts on production. The risk of future disease emergence is directly related to the opportunities created for shrimp to encounter new pathogens as the industry continues to expand and evolve. Live or frozen feeds, particularly those of crustacean or other invertebrate origin, present a particularly high risk of successful pathogen transfer because of the potentially high dose, the route of exposure and the higher likelihood of trans&#x2010;species adaptation. Polyculture of shrimp with other aquatic species, particularly invertebrates, also presents a high risk of pathogen transfer. The risk of exposure to new pathogens from natural sources in the environment will increase as shrimp aquaculture expands into new locations. It is perhaps not surprising that three of the major pathogens (V,  and ) first emerged in countries that were leaders in shrimp culture development. Although the source of V remains obscure, it is also not surprising that this virus first appeared at a time that the shrimp culture industry in Brazil was in a phase of rapid expansion. Africa now looms as a new and exciting opportunity for aquaculture development, but it is also the site of rich biodiversity and has been the source of emergence and re&#x2010;emergence of many important animal and human pathogens. The expansion of shrimp aquaculture into Africa may well provide opportunities for cross&#x2010;species transmission that will precipitate the emergence and spread of a new array of virulent shrimp pathogens. As poikilotherms, marine invertebrates are highly sensitive to changes in ambient water temperatures and global warming and associated extreme weather events are likely to impact on many aspects of their ecology and the emergence and spread of disease (). However, the disruptive environmental effect of rising global temperatures will undoubtedly present new opportunities for the emergence of new pathogens and lead to a generally greater risk of disease. The emergence and spread of disease in shrimp aquaculture has caused economic impacts on a scale rivalling that of many of the major emerging diseases of livestock and humans. It was estimated in 1996 that annual disease&#x2010;related losses in shrimp farming globally were &#x223C;$3000 million or 40% of the total production capacity of the industry (). &#x2002;Effect of disease emergence on farmed shrimp production in countries in South America and Asia. , infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus; V, infectious myonecrosis virus; , monodon slow growth; , Taura syndrome virus; V, white spot syndrome virus. &#x25;, . Although losses resulting from disease have subsided since the period of peak impact during the 1990s, V and other newly emerging pathogens continue to impact severely, particularly on the small&#x2010;holder farmers that comprise much of the industry in major producing countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and India. Lost production as a result of disease impacts on the income and food security of small&#x2010;holder farmers, as well as job security for workers on larger farms and in hatcheries, feed mills and processing plants (). As shrimp aquaculture supplies seafood markets in the , Europe and Japan, disease also impacts directly on export revenue with flow&#x2010;on impacts on socio&#x2010;economic development in the sustaining local communities in tropical coastal regions of many developing countries in Asia and the Americas. Assessing the environmental impacts of aquatic animal diseases is a complex and difficult task and rigorous scientific assessments have rarely been conducted. ), and the risks of serious environmental consequences of known or newly emerging viral diseases should not be underestimated. The indirect environmental impacts of shrimp disease are more clearly evident. Successive crop failures have led to the abandonment of affected ponds and the relocation of farming operations to new areas, compounding the problem of coastal zone and mangrove habitat degradation (). Difficulties in maintaining reliable production of the major endemic farmed species in Asia have driven a major shift to exotic species. The white Pacific shrimp (), there has been little evidence to date of displacement of endemic species and the environmental consequences of this mass translocation remain uncertain. Another potential indirect environmental impact is the use of antibiotics, disinfectants and other chemicals to prevent disease or to treat shrimp during disease outbreaks (), there are no commercially available prophylactics or treatments that have been shown to be effective against the major viral pathogens in infected shrimp. The impacts of disease on shrimp production and the environment, and the recognition that disease risks are inextricably linked to environmental conditions, have led to systemic improvements in the structure and regulated operation of the industry by international agencies, governments and farmers. Since the mid&#x2010;1990s, when disease impacts were most severe, there have been significant technological improvements, including sensitive pathogen screening tests and breeding programs for  and specific&#x2010;pathogen&#x2010;resistant () stock, and improvements to operational practices, such as structured biosecurity in hatchery and farming systems, and the adoption of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points () principles and traceability and certification procedures throughout the production cycle (). However, disease continues to impact significantly on production, particularly on small&#x2010;holder farmers, and health, environmental and product safety issues remain the highest priorities for the industry globally. As invertebrates, shrimp lack the key components of the vertebrate adaptive immune response (e.g. immunoglobulins, major&#x2010;histocompatibility&#x2010;complex () antigens, T&#x2010;cell receptors) that provide a versatile mechanism for natural protection and allow for conventional vaccination against viruses (). Monitoring of shrimp during grow&#x2010;out for early signs of disease, such as lethargy, gill fouling, unusual swimming behaviour, feeding patterns or colouration, and regular histological examination for evidence of infection is also commonly used to varying degrees by farmers. The implementation of effective disease management by medium&#x2013;large semi&#x2010;intensive farmers has impacted very significantly on productivity and delivered a range of other benefits to farmers and the community. These include less reliance on wild fisheries as a source of broodstock, better management of land and water usage and treatment of effluents, decreased use of chemicals and antibiotics, and improved quality of record keeping from stocking to market. Biosecurity is now an integral aspect of farm and hatchery management for many medium&#x2013;large farms and has largely been responsible for the recovery of the industry that has seen the volume of farmed shrimp production increase more than threefold from 2000 to 2006 ( in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, successful farming operations using  stock have been underpinned by, and continue to rely on, a more stringent approach to biosecurity. For low&#x2010;income, small&#x2010;holder farmers (&lt;1&#x2003;ha holding), who constitute a very significant sector of the industry in some Asian countries, limited education and lack of resources to implement comprehensive disease management practices are major barriers to achieving reliable production ( offer some advantage as a source of high&#x2010;quality seed, they remain susceptible to infection by V, ,  and other pathogens that are endemic throughout extensive farming systems in Asia. In view of the importance of aquaculture in maintaining food security and sustaining livelihoods in poor rural and coastal communities, there has been growing international attention to the development and implementation of practical, affordable and effective measures to reduce disease and environmental impacts for small&#x2010;holder farmers. &#x2018;Better Management Practices&#x2019; () have been developed by international teams of specialists in conjunction with industry and government. These  are based on published scientific information on the biology of infection, epidemiological studies to identify disease risk factors, empirical observations and successful industry practices, and provincial, national and international regulatory requirements (). The successful application of  in the shrimp&#x2010;farming sector in Asia has led to the development of  for small&#x2010;scale farming of other aquatic species. The availability of high&#x2010;quality seed is a critical factor in reducing the risk of crop failure during grow&#x2010;out. The increasing use of  ). One of the most difficult biosecurity issues facing the shrimp&#x2010;farming industry is transboundary movement of pathogens through trade in live shrimp ( broodstock, not all of which have been &#x2018;&#x2019;, and the subsequent use of pond&#x2010;raised progeny in local breeding programs. This has occurred despite the knowledge and costly experience of previous pandemic disease spread. The transboundary spread of viruses in frozen uncooked shrimp has also been an issue of concern (). There are indications that at least partial solutions to problems of health management in shrimp aquaculture may lie in new technologies. Although conventional vaccination, mediated by antibodies, cytokines and lymphocytes, is not possible because of the lack of a complex adaptive immune system, there is growing evidence that shrimp use a range of mechanisms to respond to viruses and these may be exploited to prevent disease or limit the spread of infection. The first suggestion of a form of induced anti&#x2010;viral immunity in shrimp was obtained when shrimp surviving natural or experimental V infection were shown to remain resistant to experimental V challenge for up to 4&#x2003;months ().  interference (i) is another anti&#x2010;viral strategy that has been shown to have the potential for application in shrimp. i is a mechanism of post&#x2010;transcriptional gene silencing by which ds, delivered into cells, is digested into small (&#x223C;21&#x2013;23&#x2003;nt) fragments that form a complex with cellular proteins that recognises, targets and guides the digestion of m containing homologous sequences (). For each of these potential anti&#x2010;viral strategies, the core remaining problem is the development of practical and cost&#x2010;effective methods for application on a commercial scale. For protein&#x2010;based &#x2018;vaccines&#x2019;, the potency of oral delivery suggests that application in shrimp feed may be practicable, but there is a lack of published experimental evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The most obvious potential application of i is in the therapeutic treatment of infected broodstock in hatcheries to generate virus&#x2010;free progeny, either for farm production or domesticated breeding programs. The prolongation of anti&#x2010;viral effects by microparticle delivery of stable  constructs expressing envelope proteins and/or hairpin  also requires further exploration. The ongoing difficulties in the management of shrimp disease are reflected in other sectors of the aquaculture industry, particularly in Asia, which accounts for &gt;90% of global aquaculture production (). National strategies should be simple, practical and achievable within available resource allocations, and should not only consider farm&#x2010;level disease management, but also the control of transboundary pathogen movements, management of chemical use, food safety and compliance with regional and international agreements and standards. The intersection of shrimp health and environmental sustainability, and the need to support socio&#x2010;economic development in poor coastal communities, should also lead governments to consider the need for infrastructure development in small&#x2010;holder shrimp&#x2010;farming regions. Commonly, shrimp ponds have proliferated in river estuaries in an unplanned and unstructured fashion without consideration of the need for appropriate water or land management. Water intake to ponds and effluent discharge are very often drawn from, and returned to, the same shared canal, and there is little cooperation in the event of disease outbreaks to avoid cross&#x2010;contamination of ponds. White spot syndrome virus is endemic in wild crustaceans in many of these farming systems and, notwithstanding strict adherence to , it is doubtful if reliable production will ever be achieved without substantial investment in infrastructure. As poor small&#x2010;holder farmers lack the necessary resources, this will require significant investment by governments or corporate benefactors in the interest of poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability. Effective disease management is a shared responsibility in which all stakeholders, from farmers to policy makers, must understand their roles and exercise responsible attitudes and behaviours. Cooperation between industry and government and adherence to policies and practices that serve long&#x2010;term sustainability and profitability rather than short&#x2010;term gains will be essential if past disease emergence scenarios and immense socio&#x2010;economic and environmental impacts are to be avoided in the future. The need for responsible behaviour applies particularly to the core problem of transboundary pathogen dispersal through irresponsible trade in live shrimp. This is a significant challenge as year&#x2010;to&#x2010;year profitability and survival are strong drivers of industry attitudes and lack of education and traditional beliefs are widespread in poor coastal communities. Achieving attitudinal change and compliance across this diverse trader sector, often operating beyond national jurisdictions, presents major challenges to policy makers and regulators. Nevertheless, attitudinal change can be achieved through effective communication and an increasing number of peak industry bodies and other farmer groups are engaging with government to assist policy formulation. Creating awareness of the importance of aquatic animal health management and its relevance to sustainable aquaculture development, aquatic animal trade and human food safety will greatly assist in achieving attitudinal changes in key stakeholders. The pattern of emergence and the global spread of an increasing array of new viral diseases of shrimp is the logical consequence of the massive ecological shift and changes in trade patterns that have accompanied the establishment and growth of a new farming industry. Key aspects of the biology and epidemiology of infection are now known for most of the major pathogens and technological advances have enabled the production of  broodstock and provided sensitive detection tools that allow screening of seed to eliminate pathogens. Although new pathogens will almost certainly emerge as the industry continues to expand into new locations and responds to the challenges presented by global warming, we should now be far better prepared to limit impacts and contain the spread of disease. The primary constraints on the effective management of existing or future diseases lie in the will and capacity of governments and industry to respond with appropriate policies and practices and the necessary levels of investment in training and infrastructure development. International cooperation and productive alliances of governments, industry and the community will be required to underpin the goal of profitable and environmentally sustainable aquaculture development.

Moreover, such studies may certainly aid in the development of new technologies aimed at retrieving specific subtypes of thrombi; as a matter of fact, thrombus composition is suggested to influence the choice of techniques used during mechanical thrombectomy and plays a role in potential device and thrombus interaction. Over the years, histological analysis on the composition of thrombi causing ischemic stroke has proved to be a powerful tool to set standard prevention and treatment protocols. By isolating clot components, it is possible to provide a more accurate diagnosis and distinguish different stroke subtypes. Studies on histological clot composition support the theory that cryptogenic stroke can have a cardiogenic origin too. Components found in thrombi extracted from stroke patients support the importance of antithrombotic therapy in preventing and treating cerebral ischemia; however, more studies are needed to improve results in all types and subtypes of stroke. Hence, more research is required to further comprehend the role that platelets, fibrin, von Willebrand factor (v), and  play in relation to mechanical thrombectomy and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt) resistance and to overcome certain limitations. Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death in high- or middle-income countries and the second most relevant cause of disability worldwide (). Here, we review the importance of histological and immunohistochemical analyses of thrombi extracted during mechanical thrombectomy in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The etiology of ischemic stroke can also be studied through the composition of retrieved thrombi. A better understanding of thrombus origin is a powerful tool for prevention, treatment, and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Stroke subtypes are classified into 5 categories based on etiology, using the Trial of  10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment () classification: ().  and  classification systems The analysis of components found in extracted thrombi has proved to be an effective tool in studying the efficacy of modern treatments, including mechanical thrombectomy. Histological staining (hematoxylin and eosin, Prussian blue, and Elastica van Gieson) and immunohistochemistry for 3, 20, and 68/KiM1P make it possible to determine the fibrin, erythrocyte, and  components and compare the results to intervention time, frequency of secondary embolisms, and additional clinical and interventional parameters. Moreover, extra useful data can be obtained by assessing preinterventional  attenuation of the thrombi in relation to the unaffected side and their association with histological features. Most fibrin-rich thrombi with low erythrocyte content are associated with longer intervention times, and thrombi with low rate of s and low  density frequently cause complications such as embolism in the thrombectomy procedure, suggesting that these thrombi have higher fragility (). After a careful reading of the current literature on the composition of thrombi retrieved from the cerebral vasculature, a few limitations were found that require significant attention. Ischemic strokes treated with mechanical thrombectomy represent only a percentage of total cases, and in all studies the only available thrombi were obtained from those patients in whom the clot did not dissolve spontaneously or during thrombolysis treatment and in whom the thrombus could be successfully retrieved. Most studies present a relatively small patient population size; thus some comparisons are not possible with small sample sizes. Furthermore, the variation in procedural techniques and the combination of devices applied to retrieve the thrombus fragments is a confounding factor that may potentially affect the rates of composition and histological distribution of the components. Another important limitation in many studies is that the use of intravenous rt might have already altered the specimens and manipulation with catheters might have produced some thrombi or fragmented them. The retrieved thrombus fragment does not always reflect the whole occlusive thrombus; thus a certain bias toward more stable clot components is common. Moreover, given the broad variation of clot composition in the evaluated sections of individual specimens, quantitative component assignments may not always be perfectly representative of the entire clot volume. Another important limitation, other than the limited number of case studies, is the predominance of specific types of ischemic stroke. As a matter of fact, most retrieved specimens are extracted from the middle cerebral arteries, rendering the results of a study a mere generalization for all the less represented subtypes. Certain studies involve the use of only hematoxylin and eosin stains for the quantitative analysis, which surely permits a direct comparison of the different components without the risk of methodological differences. However, important components such as platelets and fibrin may not be quantified successfully, and quantification can be subjected to bigger human and statistical error due to difficulties in reaching a consensus. Moreover, the use of immunological techniques may instead improve precision, meanwhile involving greater costs and requiring better equipped laboratories (). Limitations of studies and possible solutions Over the years, histological analysis aimed to study the composition of thrombi causing ischemic stroke has proved to be a powerful tool to set standard prevention and treatment protocols. By isolating the clot components, it is possible to provide a more accurate diagnosis and distinguish different stroke subtypes. Studies on histological clot composition support the theory that cryptogenic stroke can have a cardiogenic origin too. Components found in thrombi extracted from stroke patients confirm the importance of antithrombotic therapy in preventing and treating cerebral ischemia, but more studies are needed to improve results for all types and subtypes of stroke. In conclusion, more research and investigations are definitely required to further comprehend the role platelets, fibrin, v, and  play in relation to mechanical thrombectomy and recombinant rt resistance and to overcome the limitations faced by existing literature.

We conducted differentially expressed analysis on s and then performed enrichment analyses to confirm the anomalous autophagy-related biological functions. Then, we performed univariate Cox regression to screen out overall survival ()-related s. With these genes, we established an autophagy-related risk signature by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () Cox regression. We validated the reliability of the risk signature with receiver operating characteristic () analysis, survival analysis, clinic correlation analysis, and Cox regression. Then we analyzed the function of each gene in the signature by single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (A). Finally, we analyzed the correlation between our risk score and expression level of several targets of immunotherapy and targeted therapy.  We established a seven-gene prognostic risk signature, according to which we could divide patients into high or low risk groups and predict their outcomes.  analysis and survival analysis validated the reliability of the signature. Clinic correlation analysis found that the risk group is significantly correlated with severity of cc. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that the risk score could act as an independent predictor for the prognosis of cc patients. Correlation analysis between risk score and targets of precise treatments showed that our risk signature could predict the effects of precise treatment powerfully.  Our study provided a brand new autophagy-related seven-gene prognostic risk signature, which could perform as a prognostic indicator for cc. Meanwhile, our study provides a novel sight to understand the role of autophagy and suggest therapeutic strategies in the category of precise treatment in cc. Renal cell carcinoma () is one of the most common types of malignant tumors, which accounts for ~2% of all kind of cancer diagnoses and deaths worldwide. The average annual incidence cases of  are about 295,000 worldwide (). In clinical work, it is a vital and hard task to estimate the long-term outcome of tumor patients and make therapeutic decisions accordingly.  staging is a classical method for assessing the prognostic outcome of tumor patients and has been employing for almost 100 years. But, it seems that  staging could be limited or incomplete and patients in the same condition of  stage may come to entirely distinct outcomes. What's more, although most patients were diagnosed with localized disease, ~30% of early-stage patients still experience local recurrence or distant metastasis after surgery (). Thus, more effective and precise methods are needed for outcome predicting. With the rapid development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing, gene microarray technique, machine leaning, and bioinformatics analyses, researchers have found risk signature, which consists of clinical features and molecular characteristics, could act as a new approach for estimating the prognosis outcome of cc patients. Several risk signatures have shown satisfactory effects in outcome predicting, such as immune-associated gene signature (), and so on. Researchers hope that these novel approaches would help doctors make more appropriate estimations, take more personalized therapeutic strategies, increase the curative ratio for malignant tumors, and extend the overall survival () as a result for tumor patients. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway in cellular process, which is supposed to protect cells and tissues from stressors in normal physiological processes. The proper processes of autophagy are indispensable for survival, differentiation, development, and homeostasis. Recent researches have revealed that autophagy also plays an essential role in various pathological processes, especially in the pathophysiology of malignant tumor. Previous studies have demonstrated that inappropriate processes of autophagy would support the growth of tumor and some antineoplastic clinical trials have employed autophagy inhibiting as a novel therapeutic approach (). However, although quite a lot studies have investigated the patterns of gene expression of cc from different aspects and have constructed several prognostic risk signatures previously, there is no such research designed to clarify the expression pattern of autophagy-related genes (s) or attempted to develop a prognostic risk signature with s in cc. Our study aims at constructing a risk signature for cc with the expression profile of s. We obtained the whole gene expression profiles of cc and normal control from the cancer genome atlas (A) database and extracted the expression profile of all s. Then, we identified differentially expressed genes (s) between cc and normal control from all s and performed enrichment analyses on s to clarify the autophagy-related aberrant biological functions in cc. On the basis of a training dataset, we analyzed the correlation between the expression levels of s and overall survival () of patients, performed least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator () Cox regression with some s of significant correlation with , and constructed an -based risk signature as a result. We then validated the reliability of our risk signature with survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (), univariate cox regression, and correlation analysis of risk group, and clinical traits on a test dataset. We conducted single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (A) on genes of our risk signature, respectively, to explore the roles of these genes in cc. Finally, we investigated the correlation between our risk signature and the expression level of targets of immunotherapy and targeted therapy in order to help physicians predict the effects of precise treatments and decide curative strategies more efficiently. With this novel risk signature, we expect to give more helpful guidance for clinical work and a new point of mechanism research for cc. First of all, we illustrated the overall procedures of our study in a flow chart (). The flow chart of the overall procedures. We collected all transcriptome profiles of cc available in the database of A (, and samples missing any clinical characteristics were excluded in the following analyses. As the lymphatic metastasis was not regarded as an important evaluation criterion for cc clinically, and the status of lymphatic metastasis is missing in most samples, we didn't take the status of lymphatic metastasis into consideration in the current study. For drawing more convincing conclusions, we excluded samples with follow-up time shorter than 3 months. The Human Autophagy Database (b, ). To confirm if the expression levels of s have changed in tumor tissue of cc compared with normal control, we conducted differentially expressed analysis on all s based on wilcoxon test with limma package () under R environment. Here, we renamed the s extracted from s as differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (-s). We performed Gene Ontology () (). Firstly, we conducted a time-dependent univariate Cox regression with survival package under R environment for screening out genes of significant prognostic predicting value for cc from all s. Genes of significant correlations with  ( &lt; 0.01) were considered as prognosis-related genes. Meanwhile, the prognosis predictors were distinguished between risky genes and protective genes with  value ( &gt;1 means risky genes and  &lt;1 means protective genes). Then, for constructing and validating the gene signature, we divided the total of 539 tumor samples into training dataset and test dataset randomly according to a proportion of 7:3 (377 samples in training dataset and 163 samples in test dataset, information of the groups are available in ). Finally, we adopted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () Cox regression on the training dataset with top 10 -related s identified by univariate Cox regression (we selected only 10 genes for  Cox regression to avoid potential overffiting of the signature).  Cox regression was employed for two purposes. The first one is to establish a prognostic predictive module (risk signature), which could give a regression coefficient to each gene and then calculate a risk score for each patient. The other one is to filter genes of high correlations with each other to prevent overfitting of the module. The final formula of the risk signature was given as risk score = expression level of Gene1 &#x3B2;n, in which &#x3B2; represents the regression coefficient of each variable. We also performed survival analysis on selected the genes to explore the effects of single gene on the  of cc patients. To verify the validity and robustness of the  Cox regression risk signature, we calculated risk score for each patient in the test dataset and separated them into low-risk and high-risk groups based on the median of risk score. Then we conducted overall survival analysis (conducted by Kaplan&#x2013;Meier method with a two-sided log-rank test, with survival package under R environment) between the two groups to explore the difference of  between the two risk groups. Further, we assessed the efficiency of -predicting of our risk signature by operating receiver operating characteristic () curve (with survival package under R environment). At the same time, we analyzed the correlation between risk score and clinical traits to confirm the validity of our risk signature. We then performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to verify the prognostic value of the risk score. We took age, gender, tumor grade, pathological stage,  stage (lymphatic metastasis excluded) as candidate risk factors for regression analyses. We evaluated if all these factors are risk factors for worse outcomes by univariate Cox regression analysis, and further determined if the risk score calculated by our risk signature could be utilized for predicting the prognosis of cc patients independently. In order to clarify the potential roles of genes included in our risk signature in cc, we performed single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (A) ( &lt; 0.05. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy are revolutionary and effective approaches for cc treatment. Food and Drug Administration () have approved kinds of precise therapies in the past decades (). According to the screening criteria of s, 89 of the 231 s showed significant alterations of expression levels in cc compared with normal control, including 61 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated genes, respectively.

We calculated the risk score for each patient in training dataset and divided them into high-risk group and low-risk group based on the median of risk score. Patients in high-risk group are deemed to be at higher risk of death. Then we assessed the prediction efficiency of the risk signature by operating a  curve, which revealed that the risk score could predict the 5-year survival rate for cc patient effectively ( = 75%, ).

We calculated the risk score for patients and divided them into high-risk group and low-risk group in test dataset with the same formula mentioned above. We performed overall survival analysis on the two groups. Patients in low-risk group had obviously better outcome (). As the overall survival analysis and  analysis have demonstrated the satisfactory robustness of the prognostic value of our risk signature, we put the training dataset and test dataset together again for subsequent analyses. We applied correlation analysis between risk group and clinicopathologic features with chi-square test to find high risk score is closely related to tumor grade (). Moreover, the expression patterns of the seven genes were quite similar in the same group and differed distinctly between different groups, hinting the accuracy of the risk signature.

Further, we applied multivariate Cox regression for determining if the risk score could be utilized as an independent prognosis predictor for cc patients.

The results of Cox regression analyses confirmed that the risk score derived from s could act as an independent prognosis predictor for cc patients. The efficiency of predicting would not be affect by any clinicopathologic features of the tumor. Single-gene A of the seven genes has shown the potential roles of the genes in cc (. Results of single-gene A of seven genes in our risk signature in cc. (, respectively). Results of Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that our risk score was significantly correlated with the m expression level of . Results of correlation analysis between our risk score and expression level of targets of precise treatment in cc. (, respectively). In the current study, we used the expression profile of the tumor tissue of cc patients as well as normal control downloaded from A database to construct an autophagy-related prognostic gene risk signature. We obtained 231 s from b database and extracted an expression profile contains only s. We performed differentially expressed analysis on s and screened out 89 -s. Enrichment analyses on these -s elucidated that the irregular biological processes are mainly involved in themes as follow: the response of tumor toward oxygen level and starvation, the resistance of tumor to some treatment strategies, and several well-known tumor-related pathways, such as p53 signaling pathway. We then identified -related s with univariate Cox regression analysis. With the top 10 -related s, we developed a novel prognostic risk signature trained by  Cox regression. With the risk signature, we calculated the risk score for each patient and divided all patients into high-risk group and low-risk group. The result of overall survival analysis revealed that the  of high-risk group was significantly poorer than that of low-risk group, and  analysis reflected a satisfactory accuracy of the risk signature ( = 75% in training dataset and 71% in test dataset). Meanwhile, clinic correlation analysis showed that the risk group was closely related to tumor grade, pathological stage, T stage, and distant metastasis. We validated the reliability of our risk signature by the three approached above. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression found that the risk score could act as a satisfactory independent predictor for the prognosis of cc patients. In order to clarify the potential roles of the seven genes in cc, we conducted single-gene A for each gene. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation between our -related risk score with targets of immunotherapy and targeted therapy to find our risk score significantly correlated with the m expression level five therapy targets, providing potential guidance for personalized treatments. In all, our work implied that dysfunction of autophagy plays a vital role in the process of cc. Most importantly, we have developed a robust -based prognostic risk signature for cc for the first time, which is of great relevance to clinicians and patients and may provide a more precise estimate method for the prognosis of cc patients and more individualized treatment strategies accordingly. It is worth mentioning that we conduct  Cox regression with not only -s, but also s weren't included in s. Interestingly, we found some genes influence the  of patients strongly in survival analysis but didn't reach the criterion of -s. For example, the statistical significance of  = 1.78E-09, and the 5-year survival rate different sharply in high-risk and low-risk groups, but the log of the gene was low as &#x2212;0.118. On the contrary, some genes were -s but their influences on  were not such significant. This phenomenon reminds us that we should not judge the importance of genes by differentially expressed analysis and should take all -related genes into consideration while establishing a risk signature. Autophagy is a relatively conserved process in normal physiological processes (). Briefly, we have sufficient reasons to believe that regulating the status of autophagy properly would help us to carve a new path in the treatment of cc. Our risk signature is comprised of seven genes, including  in tumor yet. Nonetheless, there are still some limitations in our study. First, we established the prognosis signature only with the expression profile of cc obtained from  Although we have divided all date into two parts of training dataset and test dataset, and then validated the robustness of the prognostic signature established in training dataset with the data in test dataset, our conclusion would be more convincing with validation in independent external datasets. We would like to complete this portion of work after collecting some samples and data of expression profile by ourselves. Secondly, the biological functions of the genes making up the prognostic signature are needed to be explored deeply in cc. Briefly, our work established an autophagy-related prognostic risk signature for the first time and validated its reliability successfully. Our work might provide a novel method for prognosis predicting and personalized therapeutic strategies selecting.

Studies evaluating smoke-free laws are scarce in Sub-Saharan Africa. Evaluation of smoke-free laws is an effective means of measuring progress towards a smoke-free society. This study assessed the level of compliance to the provisions of the current smoke-free policy using air quality measurements for fine particulate matter () in hospitality venues in Ghana. This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted in 2019 using a structured observational checklist complemented with air quality measurements using Dylos monitors across 152 randomly selected hospitality venues in three large cities in Ghana. Smoking was observed in a third of the venues visited. The median indoor ) (p&lt;0.001). Hospitality locations in Accra, Ghana&#x2019;s capital city, had the lowest compliance levels (59.5%) and poorer air quality compared to the cities of Kumasi and Tamale. The study shows that while smoking and  exposure continues in a substantial number of hospitality venues, there is a marked improvement in  concentrations compared to earlier studies in Ghana. There is still a considerable way to go to increase compliance with the law. Efforts are needed to develop an action plan to build upon recent progress in providing smoke-free public spaces in Ghana. Implementing smoke-free legislation remains a challenge in many low- and middle-income countries (Cs). However, with 77% of all smoking-related deaths and 89% of secondhand smoke () related-deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries, it is clear that the burden of the tobacco epidemic has moved from high-income countries (s) to Cs. Article 8 of the World Health Organization () Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (C). Ghana, being one of the first countries to ratify the  C in 2004, passed a Tobacco Control Act in 2012 as part of its legal obligation. Reducing the exposure to  is an important public health challenge that has been recognized by policymakers and regulators, and smokers&#x2019; behaviour is influenced in part by their understanding of smoke-free legislation. Though the  recommends that all countries implement comprehensive smoke-free policies, defined as smoke-free policies with no exemptions for particular venue types or allowances for designated smoking areas, Ghana has a partial smoke-free policy that allows smoking to continue in certain types of enclosed public venues. There is limited evidence relating to the evaluation of the current smoke-free law and compliance levels in Ghana. Studies conducted in Ghana pre law (2007) indicated very high levels of  exposure (median , as a marker of ) in hospitality venues. This was a cross-sectional study comprising objective measurements of airborne fine particulate matter () in hospitality venues across three cities in Ghana. The measurements were complemented with covert observations of smoking related behavior, signage and compliance with local laws in each venue. A team comprising the researcher and four research assistants received training on air-quality monitoring using a low-cost monitor and compliance studies involving observational data collection. Training involved: how to operate a Dylos 1700 (Dylos Inc, , ) air quality monitor; how to download acquired data; and how to collect data in hospitality venues using an observation checklist protocol similar to that used in studies in similar settings over the past decade. The protocol included details on venue selection, visit duration, researcher safety, inside/outside air monitoring duration, logging data, assessment sheet instructions, and data transferring. The study was conducted in the three largest cities in Ghana; Accra, Kumasi and Tamale (due to their large population density, diversity, and high smoking prevalence). A list of 1532 hospitality venues of bars/pubs/restaurants/hotels and nightclubs in the three cities was obtained from the Ghana tourist authority. These venues were then stratified into the 3 major cities of the southern, middle and northern belts of Ghana, respectively; Kumasi (457), Accra (949), and Tamale (126). Using a margin of error of 5%, confidence limit of 95% and a no-response rate of 87.7%, a total of 154 venues were obtained as the sample size of the study. A proportionate allocation was then done for each of the three cities to gather a convenience sample of 150 venues across the country. A random number generator (Minitab version 17) was then used to randomly select 150 venues from each city. Visits took place during peak working hours (from 16:00 to midnight) in each of the selected cities. In cases where the venue was closed or no longer in operation, the venue next on the list was visited. A total of 154 venues were visited from the three cities. Data were collected over a 10-week period from July to September 2019 including a three-day pilot data collection in Kumasi. All data collection at the hospitality venues was done in pairs (the researcher and an assistant) on any particular day. Observational methods such as visual inspection of a venue (e.g. surveying rooms for the posting of &#x2018;No Smoking&#x2019; signs, staff/customer smoking, presence of s, evidence of ashtrays and cigarette butts) and semi-subjective assessment of the presence of recent smoking through self-reported smell of smoke from the researcher are a relatively simple and inexpensive methods of assessing  exposure measurements) hence informed consent was not taken, however, researchers carried an official letter during field work describing the study plus evidence of ethical approval and contact details. All the places in which data collection occurred were &#x2018;public places&#x2019; and the individuals and the specific locations remain protected by anonymity and confidentiality. Study team staff downloaded the air quality data using Dylos Logger software. The Dylos 1700 measures and records the concentration of particles as described above. Each Dylos device had a specific calibration factor applied from a chamber experiment where measured concentrations of   levels across the whole dataset and then subdivided by city, venue type and size of venue using S version 22. Observation data from the standardized checklist were also entered onto an excel sheet, coded and analysed using S version 22. The data were recorded at three time intervals (entry, +15 minutes and +30 minutes) and the mean of the three values was used for the analysis. Descriptive statistics including percentages, proportions, means, standard deviation and medians were generated. The &#x2018;average compliance&#x2019; to the smoke-free law was calculated by adding up the values of &#x2018;individual compliance indicators&#x2019; and dividing it by the total number of indicators measured. As noted above, a total of 154 venues from three cities were included in the sample. However, two of the venues from Accra and Kumasi had incomplete information, thus 152 venues were included in the final analysis. Out of the 152 venues visited, 62% (n=94) were in Accra, 30% (n=45) in Kumasi and 9% (n=13) in Tamale. About two-thirds (65%, n=94) of the venues were hotels, 15% (n=22) were bars/pubs and 20% (n=29) restaurants. Most of the venues (70%, n=106) were large and permanent structures and could accommodate more than 30 people at a time. The indicators of compliance (presence of s and no-smoking signs, absence of smell of smoke, cigarette butts, ashtrays and any active smoking) were assessed in all 152 venues.  G signs were evident in half of the venues (49.5%, n=75) with considerable variations by city: Accra (54.3%, n=51), Kumasi (35.6%, n=16), and Tamale (61.5%, n=8), with s present in less than 10% of the venues (6.6%, n=10) (). More than 90% of the venues visited did not have cigarette or other tobacco products displayed for sale. The total average compliance for all the venues was 63.1% with Accra being the least compliant (59.5%). Compliance with specific indicators of smoke-free law in three cities, Ghana p-value based on Fisher&#x2019;s exact test. Only one venue in Kumasi was fully compliant with all the indicators. Bars and pubs were found to be the least compliant with indicators of smoke-free legislation compared to hotels and restaurants (). Compliance with specific indicators in hotels, bars/pubs and restaurants Only one hotel in Kumasi was compliant with all indicators. The field observers also rated  exposure in all the venues as low or zero, medium and high during covert observations and these were converted to binary variables (as present or absent) for analysis. Close to half of the venues in Accra had evidence of  exposure, and bars and pubs were more likely to have  exposure compared to hotels and restaurants ().

The study results demonstrate that close to 60% of the hospitality locations in the three cities were at least partially compliant with the current smoke-free legislation and had no observed smoking during our visit. Findings from other Cs such as India (where smoking prevalence is much higher) using similar methods for assessing compliance to smoke-free laws recorded higher levels of compliance (&gt;80%) in hospitality locations. This may partly be explained by the development of state- and district-level tobacco control laws alongside strong enforcement of the law in India, which may account for the higher compliance levels. In our study, smoking was observed in about a third of the venues (in areas meant to be smokefree) and less than 1% of the hospitality locations had s and about 50% of the venues had  G signage. Interestingly, less than 10% of the venues had tobacco products for sale. Findings from our study clearly indicate that hospitality locations (particularly in Accra) are not fully compliant with current smoke-free legislation several years after the ratification of the C (2004) and passage of the National Tobacco Control Act (2012). Findings from other countries in Africa such as Kenya with a similar smoke-free policy like Ghana, indicated that smoking occurred in about 85% of hospitality locations. The second part of our study objectively assessed  exposure by measuring  in the current study, an almost 97% reduction. Ghana has made significant progress in terms of improved air quality measurements in hospitality settings. However, public smoke-free law does not fully meet the standards of the  C Article 8 (to which Ghana is a Party to); thus, both smokers and non-smokers continue to remain unprotected against  in many hospitality locations. There is no risk-free level of  and even brief/minimal exposure can cause immediate harm. The results and outcome of this research serve as a basis for discussions on the need to develop specific policies to protect consumers and employees of such premises, and also implement enforcement measures to improve compliance. The study&#x2019;s major strength is the use of a random strategy to sample hospitality venues compared to the previous study in Ghana and several other studies elsewhere that have relied on convenience sampling thus introducing selection bias. Also, the inclusion of a large number of hospitality venues in the three largest cities in Ghana including the use of an objective and subjective assessment of  provides a more detailed estimation of  exposure in this setting. However, the study has several limitations that need to be noted when considering the study results. First,  is a well-established marker for  and highly correlates with air nicotine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study measuring  concentrations and compliance to the smoke-free law in randomly selected hospitality locations within Ghana&#x2019;s three largest cities. Smoking was observed in about 37% of the venues and less than one per cent (&lt;1%) of venues were fully compliant with all the measured indicators of compliance. However, there is marked improvement in air quality in these venues compared to earlier studies. Possible reasons for this improvement might be the introduction of the Tobacco Control Act (2012) and the .2247 during this period, which could have led to greater enforcement of smoke-free policies compared to earlier studies and also decreasing smoking prevalence over the years. Fifteen years after the adoption of the  C and more than five years after a National Tobacco Control Act, the study identified challenges for complete protection from  through legislation. There is still a considerable way to go to increase compliance with the  law in Ghana. Efforts are needed to develop an action plan to build on progress towards changing societal norms around smoking in hospitality venues and to ensure greater enforcement of existing smoke-free policy in Ghana.

Here, a single-tube multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat (R) analysis (A) genotyping assay, targeting eight R loci, was developed for studying the epizootiology of  Through A typing of V positive samples from 180 farmed and wild Atlantic salmon in Northern Europe, the first molecular population study of this virus was undertaken. Comparison of resulting A profiles by cluster analysis revealed considerable micro-diversity, while only a limited degree of specific clustering by country of origin could be observed, and no clustering relating to the severity of disease outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis, based on genomic data from six V specimens (three Norwegian, one Scottish, one Faroese and one Canadian), complemented and corroborated A by pointing to a marked transatlantic divide in the species, with one main, relatively conserved, V lineage as predominant in Europe. Within certain fjord systems and individual freshwater salmon smolt farms in Norway, however, discrete A clustering patterns that prevailed over time were observed, likely reflecting local predominance of specific V sub-lineages. A typing was also used to refute two suspected instances of vertical V transmission from salmon broodstock to offspring, and to confirm a failed disinfection attempt in one farm. These novel insights into the previously undocumented population structure of V provide important clues, e.g., regarding the mechanisms underlying spread and recurrence of the virus amongst wild and farmed salmon populations, but so far no indications of more or less virulent V sub-lineages have been found. The A scheme represents a highly sensitive genotyping tool particularly well suited for illuminating V infection routes, and adds to the relatively low number of A protocols that have so far been published for viral species. Typing is reasonably inexpensive, with a moderate technological requirement, and may be completed within a single working day. Resulting A profiles can be readily shared and compared across laboratories, facilitating rapid placement of samples in an international ezpizootiological context. While historic and ongoing expansions of industrialized aquaculture activities worldwide are among the most important initiatives for feeding a growing global population, these industries have suffered significant setbacks, e.g., due to infectious fish diseases. In Norway, the world&#x2019;s largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon (). Members of the ). A challenge model proving causality is currently under development (unpublished data). Salmon gill poxvirus is now recognized as a widespread virus in Norwegian salmon farming, where it commonly causes recurring acute disease outbreaks of varying severity, although subclinical V detections are also regularly made. Clinical outbreaks are often associated with complex gill disease concurrently with a diverse range of cellular organisms, including, e.g., ). Despite the wide distribution of V, published data on the extent of genetic diversity within the viral population(s) is lacking. For instance, the highly variable clinical presentations reported in relation to detections could conceivably reflect the existence of more or less virulent strains of the virus. Unfortunately however, while the Canadian strain reportedly replicated in cell cultures (), repeated attempts of viral cultivation and isolation from European V samples have not yet been successful, thus limiting further molecular and functional investigations. High-throughput (e.g., Illumina) sequencing performed directly on infected gill samples was therefore necessary for the genomic characterization of V, but as this approach is relatively expensive and laborious, it is unsuitable for routine use on large numbers of samples. Multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (A) constitutes a molecular genotyping method particularly well suited for investigating close evolutionary relationships between conspecific biological specimens. The technique exploits a pre-defined selection of hypervariable genomic loci, commonly named variable-number tandem-repeats (R) or mini-/microsatellites, which, over generations, are subject to frequent successive changes in size. The approach is fast, inexpensive and produces readily transferrable data, while providing an epidemiological resolution in some cases matching that of whole genome sequencing (). In light of the increasingly recognized significance of V in salmon farming internationally, and the potential related risks for wild salmon populations, there is an acute need for establishing expedient, high-resolution genotyping tools enabling epizootiological investigations. The very large genome of this virus, in combination with the apparent multitude of repetitive  regions contained within it (), furthermore makes V a fitting candidate for A typing. The primary aim of the present study was therefore to establish such an assay, and to conduct an A genotyping survey highlighting V population dynamics. To generate additional V genome information, one gill sample from wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon, and three additional gill samples from farmed Atlantic salmon (Norwegian, Faroese and Scottish) (see ). The amino acid sequences of two genes (major capsid protein and -directed  polymerase subunit beta) were acquired from various published ). A total of 310 gill samples were initially compiled, consisting primarily of diagnostic samples harvested from farmed and wild Atlantic salmon over multiple years in four European countries (), with reported Ct-values ranging from 16 to 37. Total g was extracted as described above and subsequently used as template for downstream applications, or stored at &#x2212;20&#xB0;C until such use. From the 310 Atlantic salmon gill samples testing positive for V by q, the table shows the origins of the 180 samples successfully A typed in the present study.

Map created with Google Earth (Map data/imagery: , Landsat/Copernicus, , A, . Navy, , , . Geological Survey). The five European V genomic contig sets (one previously published and four generated during the present study) were all subjected to analysis with Tandem Repeats Finder v4 (). A multiplex  assay was established involving 16 primers pairwise targeting each of the eight R loci (). Primers were designed using Geneious R7 (Biomatters), and checked for formation of secondary structures with Multiple Primer Analyzer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and for V specificity by performing  searches against the I nucleotide collection. For each primer pair (Applied Biosystems), either of the forward- or reverse primer was labeled at the 5&#x2019; end with either of four fluorescent dyes (6, , , or ). Particular care was taken to avoid amplicon size overlap between loci labeled with identical dyes. Multiplex  mixtures contained 10 &#x3;l 2&#xD7; Multiplex  master mix (Qiagen), 0.2 &#x3;M of each primer, 1 &#x3;l  template, and a volume of ase-free water amounting to a total reaction volume of 20 &#x3;l. Subsequent  involved (i) 5 min at 95&#xB0;C (ii) 30 cycles of 0.5 min at 95&#xB0;C, 3 min at 60&#xB0;C, and 1 min at 72&#xB0;C, and (iii) 45 min at 68&#xB0;C, followed by cooling to 4&#xB0;C indefinitely.  products were verified by gel electrophoresis (as shown in ) and then diluted 1:8 (vol/vol) in Milli-Q water. From the dilutions, 1 &#x3;l was added to 8.5 &#x3;l Hi-Di formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 &#x3;l GeneScan 600  dye size standard v2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Samples were then denatured for 5 min at 95&#xB0;C prior to capillary electrophoresis on an Avant 3500xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) utilizing -7 polymer (Applied Biosystems) and the following settings: 5 s injections at 1.6 kV (32 V/cm), and a 32 min run time at 15 kV (300 V/cm) and 60&#xB0; Following capillary electrophoresis, electrophoretic peaks were size called with GeneMapper 5 (Applied Biosystems) and assigned to appropriate R loci according to fluorescent labeling and size. Samples displaying multiple ambiguous signals were excluded at this stage unless all secondary peaks displayed less than half the signal intensity of the primary peaks (see section &#x201C;Results&#x201D; and  for further details). R amplicon sizes called by capillary electrophoresis displayed some disagreement with Sanger sequence sizes, a phenomenon attributed to biased mobility patterns of amplicons in capillary electrophoresis machines (). Each V specimen thus received an eight-digit integer string (A profile) reflecting the number of whole repeats determined at each R locus. An exception was however made for locus V_143, wherein some variants proved to carry a 6 bp insertion directly downstream of the repeat region. Having a repeat size of 13 bp, the V_143 repeat count for alleles harboring this insertion was thus instead rounded upward to the nearest half. Absent capillary electrophoresis peaks in any locus (only relevant in two specimens for V_67) were assigned a repeat count of 0. The discriminatory capacity of the studied R loci, individually and in combination, was estimated through calculation of Simpson&#x2019;s indexes of diversity (), employing the Monte Carlo-model with 10,000 iterations, was used for detecting possible linkage disequilibrium occurring amongst the loci. Only single representatives for each A profile were included for N analysis. As outlined in the ). For simplicity, these estimations assumed a random allele distribution in all loci and did not consider the very likely existence of yet undiscovered R alleles. Metrics for each R locus within the studied dataset, as inferred from A typing. All A profiles generated were imported into BioNumerics v7.6 (Applied Maths , Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium), and Minimum-spanning-tree cluster analysis was performed with default settings. In the network thus resulting from comparison of the whole dataset, branches representing connection of profiles identical in &#x2264;5/8 R loci were hidden, a threshold deduced from the likelihood estimations outlined above, based on allelic diversity and dataset size. For Minimum-spanning-trees generated from smaller subsets of profiles, selected based on miscellaneous metadata (geographic origin etc.), branch connections of &#x2264;4/8 identical loci were hidden. As culturing of European V variants has not yet been successful, the  stability of the targeted loci.

Map created with Google Maps (Map data/imagery: , Nasa, TerraMetrics). Approximately 90 putatively repetitive loci were identified from each of the five examined V genomic contig sets. Following ), were ultimately selected for A inclusion. While Sanger sequencing performed on 12 V samples revealed minor repeat unit sequence heterogeneity in all loci but V_218 and V_227, repeat unit size uniformity was confirmed for all loci (data available upon request). A single-tube A assay based on eight R loci, involving multiplex  and capillary electrophoresis, was thus designed and tested. Upon running the final assay on 310 V positive salmon gill samples, multiple specific  products were in most cases visually detectable as clear bands by gel electrophoresis (example in ). In some cases, increasing the  template volume resolved this issue. Notably, no  amplicons were produced from controls consisting of V negative (by q) salmon gill samples. Chart showing the percentage of samples, within different q Ct-value ranges, for which A  produced a full set of eight R amplicons. Numbers above the bars indicate the total number of samples falling within each range. Notably, for some of the samples A typed in this study, q Ct-value measures were not available. Capillary electrophoresis was only attempted on samples showing  amplification of multiple R targets by gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretic peaks following capillary electrophoresis, individually corresponding to either of the eight R loci, could readily be distinguished based on fluorescent labeling and size (). While for most examined samples capillary electrophoresis revealed only eight fluorescent peaks (), two separate readings of eight electrophoretic peaks each were recorded and subjected to downstream analyses. Importantly, in such cases, both inferred profiles were often identified (together and/or individually) in several fish sampled from the same outbreak/farm/river, thus corroborating their authenticity. Throughout the dataset, ambiguities were observed multiple times in all eight loci. From the 310 gill samples initially included in the study, 130 were thus excluded due to either lacking  amplification or unresolvable ambiguity following capillary electrophoresis. For the remaining 180 samples, 47 displayed duplicate signals, resulting in a total of 227 A profiles recorded (). The allelic diversity of individual R loci within the examined dataset ranged from 2 to 11 alleles (excluding missing amplicons), with Simpson&#x2019;s indexes of diversity ranging between 0.483 and 0.821 ( &lt; 0.0001), which thus differs significantly from zero, confirming linkage disequilibrium. Under the assumption of random allele distribution in all loci, and considering only the allelic diversity observed in this study (), thus making individual A connections between specimens represented by &#x2264;5/8 identical loci untrustworthy. Considering the examined sample collection, however, these figures are presumably considerable overestimates &#x2013; for one due to the likely existence of yet undiscovered alleles, but not least due to the inclusion of large sub-groups of epizootiologically related samples likely rendering the dataset less diverse than a truly random dataset of this size. For evaluation of putative epizootiological connections between the examined V samples, A cluster analysis was visualised in Minimum-spanning-trees. A continuous network of interconnections, dominated by Norwegian samples recovered from 1995 to 2019, linked 82% (186/227) of the A profiles within a threshold of &#x2265;6/8 identical loci (). This proportion increased to 97 and 100%, respectively for &#x2265;5/8 and &#x2265;4/8 identical loci. Upon relating available information regarding time of sampling and/or outbreak severity (data not shown) to clustering within the network, no pervasive trends were observed.

The continuous network of interconnections produced between 186 out of the 227 profiles, within a threshold of &#x2265;6/8 identical loci, has a gray background. Particular sub-selections of specimens, for which a relaxed threshold of &#x2265;5/8 identical loci was considered, displayed varying degrees of clustering bias linked to origin. Specifically, geographically linked clustering was documented through comparison of V samples from returning wild salmon spawners in rivers connected to two distant fjord systems in Norway (), but in none of these cases was a high A similarity observed across fish types. Minimum-spanning-trees based on V A profiles, with branch representations indicated in the common centered legend (alternative branch connections, or crosslinks, have terminal demarcations). Coloring is with regard to river- or smolt farm of origin in Norway (for reference and further details, see  shows the relationships between 43 V specimens originating from eight different freshwater farms for Atlantic salmon smolt. Unless heterogeneity was observed, only single samples from individual case submission were included for comparison. Two investigated cases involved suspicion of vertical V transmission from a single Atlantic salmon broodstock farm to two separate recipient hatcheries, as V disease outbreaks were diagnosed at the juvenile stage in both sibling groups. V positive samples for comparison were also available from said broodstock farm, and from recent V disease outbreaks having occurred in separate (unrelated) noncontact fish groups at both hatcheries. The Minimum-spanning-tree based on the entire dataset reveals that none of the offspring batches harbored V variants similar to that found in the parental broodstock &#x2013; instead, these formed perfect A matches with the specimens found previously in the respective hatcheries (). The same Minimum-spanning-tree as presented in , but with coloring (see legend) here reflecting specific farm origins &#x2013; i.e., from a single Atlantic salmon broodstock farm, or from either of two hatcheries, both of which experienced V disease outbreaks in offspring from said broodstock farm, and also in thus unrelated, noncontact fish groups. Of note, typing of 16 gill samples harvested from individual fish following a previous V infection trial revealed complete R homogeneity amongst the resulting A profiles, which also matched perfectly with that of the challenge strain. The capacity to discern genetic relationships between conspecific specimens of a pathogen with a high resolution is central for resolving, e.g., transmission events underlying their dissemination. Barring available culturing methods for V, we developed a single-tube eight-locus A assay that enables specific, high-resolution genotyping of this virus directly from infected gill tissue. Initial phylogenetic analysis verified a transatlantic genetic divide in this species, while A typing and cluster analysis performed on samples from infected Atlantic salmon allowed interpretation of V population dynamics in Europe. It was recently documented that V is widespread amongst wild populations of Atlantic salmon along the Norwegian coast (). A Simpson&#x2019;s index of diversity of 0.978 for all eight targeted R loci combined reflects the high-resolution typing made possible by the assay, while complete R homogeneity across all samples from a single controlled infection trial assures assay robustness and sufficient stability for epizootiological relevance. Although the observation of ambiguous A signals prompted the exclusion of some samples from the study, two separate A readings could often be reliably inferred from individual samples (). In such cases, both detected profiles commonly recurred (together and/or individually) in several fish from the same site. It is therefore reasonable to presume that this reflects a scenario involving the preceding presence of multiple V variants in said environments, rather than spontaneous mutations arising in the virus after infection. Although phylogenetic analysis points to one main, relatively conserved, V lineage dominating in the Northeast Atlantic region, European specimens populate dispersed and partly disconnected A clusters (). Despite what presents as an overall lack of distantly separated genetic lineages within the sampled V population, scrutiny of restricted sub-selections of samples serve to exemplify the inherent potential of the A assay for fine-scale epizootiological inference. For instance, discrete clustering was observed for V specimens from wild, returning salmon spawners migrating through separate Norwegian fjord-systems, but only minor colocation bias occurred at the level of individual rivers (). These geographic trends are not consistent for all Norwegian rivers represented in the study, however, as near-identical A profiles were also occasionally detected in wild-fish samples from distant regions. Interpretation of this is complicated by the nationwide occurrence of this virus in Norwegian salmon aquaculture, which represents a potential infection reservoir for wild salmon (and vice versa), and where no overarching geographic trends could be inferred from A clustering (example in ). Information regarding potential non-salmon reservoirs is also lacking. Notably, while the few samples collected from wild- and farmed salmon in nearby areas displayed relatively low A similarities, these observations do not provide sufficient basis for making firm predictions regarding the extent of transmission occurring between wild- and farmed fish. These matters could be the focus of future investigations. At the level of individual freshwater farms for salmon smolt in Norway, there is nevertheless a tendency for consecutive V outbreaks over multiple years and generations of fish being caused by specific sub-lineages of the virus (). These mentioned real-life applications of the developed A assay highlight its potential as an expedient investigative tool for rapid tracing of V detections. A single-tube eight-locus A genotyping scheme was developed and employed for typing of a large collection of V samples from farmed and wild Atlantic salmon in Northern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis in combination with A typing point to one main V lineage as dominating in this region, with a distinct variant previously detected on the Canadian Atlantic coast. Further scrutiny, by A, of smaller sample groups from discrete origins enabled identification of specific V sub-lineages likely reflecting locally predominant viral strains within fjord systems, as well as persistent and/or recurring &#x201C;house strains&#x201D; in freshwater smolt farms. The assay was also used to disprove suspected vertical transmissions of V and to verify a failed disinfection attempt, thus emphasizing its potential application for inferring infection routes and during evaluation of ameliorative measures. No indication of intrinsically high- or low-virulent V sub-lineages was found. In summary, the method represents a highly sensitive and easily implemented tool that is well suited for molecular tracing of V detections.

Of the 24 known measles genotypes, only D8 and B3 are responsible for outbreaks in the last years in Europe, Asia, and America. In this study the H gene of 92 strains circulating between 2015 and 2019 in Lombardy, Northern Italy, and 1273 H sequences available in GenBank were analyzed in order to evaluate the genetic variability and to assess the conservation of the immunodominant sites. Overall, in Lombardy we observed the presence of four different B3 and three different D8 clusters, each one of them including sequences derived from viruses found in both vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Worldwide, the residue 400 within the H protein, a position located within the main immune epitope, is mutated in all circulating strains that belong to the two globally endemic genotypes, B3 and D8. Our data demonstrate the usefulness of measles virus () H gene sequencing. Indeed, the monitoring the H protein epitopes of circulating strains could be included in the measles laboratory surveillance activities in order to improve and optimize strategies for measles control, as countries go towards elimination phase. Measles is a highly contagious disease that results from the infection with measles virus (), an  virus member of the genus ]. The  recognizes 24  genotypes (A, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, E, F, G1, G2, G3, H1, and H2), divided in eight clades (A&#x2013;H). Despite its genetic heterogeneity,  is considered serologically monotypic []. The vaccination coverage to be achieved to obtain herd immunity and prevent epidemics from indigenous or imported cases depends on the vaccine efficacy. Thus, it is of crucial importance to evaluate the evolution over time of circulating genotypes and their variants to prevent the spread of strains that are capable of (partially) escaping vaccine-induced immune response. Nowadays, only three of the 24 known  genotypes are responsible for outbreaks worldwide []. To monitor the progress of the measles elimination program, genetic analysis of s has been promoted by the  since 1998 []. This sequence information is essential to predict the antigenic changes of the H protein and to achieve a better monitoring of the response to the vaccine. Although  is antigenically stable, specific amino acid changes in the H protein can cause minor antigenic variations [], it is of crucial importance to evaluate the antigenic relatedness between the circulating genotypes and vaccine strains. Aims of this study are to investigate the global phylogeny of the H gene of s and study the molecular epidemiology of B3 and D8 strains circulating in Lombardy (Northern Italy), the most populated Italian region accounting for nearly 10 of the 60 million inhabitants, in the last five years. Furthermore, we evaluated the presence of amino acid mutations in the determined H protein sequences of viruses identified in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to identify potential antigenic changes, with particular focus on the different known immune epitopes. In this study we evaluated 92 H sequences of s identified in Lombardy between 2015 and 2019, both from vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. This set included 19 complete H sequences of genotype B3 obtained during a previous study [-450 sequence), epidemiological information (whether the case was sporadic or associated to an outbreak), the origin of the strain (whether it was an autochthonous or imported case), and vaccination status of the infected individuals. All complete or nearly complete  H sequences were downloaded from the public GenBank database and aligned to sequences obtained in this study. The resulting alignment (1346 sequences) was used to build a phylogenetic tree () in order to identify the phylogenetic placement of B3 and D8 sequences. Fifty-three out of 92 strains (57.6%), 98.4&#x2013;100% identical to each other and detected between 2015 and 2018, were classified as B3. The remaining 39 sequences (42.4%), 98.1&#x2013;100% identical and identified between 2017 and 2019, were classified as D8. Overall, 11 out of 29 strains from individuals with a documented history of vaccination (37.9%) belonged to genotype B3, while the remaining 18 (62.1%) were classified as D8. All B3 or D8 sequences were extracted and used for further investigations (see following sections). After removing identical and potentially recombinant sequences from the original dataset, 857 sequences from all genotypes were used to investigate which sites were subjected to pervasive and episodic positive selection pressure. , a Bayesian algorithm that identifies sites subjected to positive and negative selection using posterior probabilities [], identified an additional 19 positively selected sites (84, 85, 89, 183, 203, 225, 250, 265, 282, 287, 367, 369, 479, 502, 520, 570, 572, 593, 616). Of these, only two were located within immunogenic epitopes: 546, located in the , and 250, located in the  Finally, 53.3% of sites in the considered immune epitopes (40/75) were under negative selection pressure. Overall, 206 out of 1346 H sequences were identified that could be classified as B3, representing 15.3% of the total. The tree built with all these sequences (shown  = 127) and that was characterized by a mutation at amino acid position 400, where the alanine (A) was substituted by a valine (V). This clade will be referred to from now of as clade B3-400 Remarkably, while clade B3-400V included sequences identified more recently (2006&#x2013;2018) and primarily in non-African countries (i.e., Europe: Spain, Italy, France, , Germany; Asia: Iran, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan; America: Canada, ), all other B3 sequences, characterized by an older isolation date (1993&#x2013;2012), were found predominantly in Africa. ). All clade B3-400V sequences from Lombardy (indicated by a black circle, a red circle, or a red triangle for unvaccinated subjects, individuals who received two doses of the vaccine, and subjects vaccinated once, respectively) grouped within four different clusters, two of which included sequences from 2015&#x2013;2016 (clusters O and ) as we previously reported [ sequencing (Dublin, Ljubljana, and Saint Denis). Clusters  and O also included sequences from France, while cluster D/L/ also contained sequences from Padua, an Italian city in a region neighboring Lombardy. Sequences belonging to all clusters were identified both in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Interestingly, the cluster  contained only sequences from either unvaccinated individuals or subjects who received only one dose of the vaccine, while clusters O and D/L/ contained sequences from all groups, independently from vaccination status. To identify key amino acid substitutions, we plotted amino acid changes associated to main branches (in green) as well as those identified specifically in the investigated strains (black and red for those found in unvaccinated and vaccinated subjects, respectively). Most sequences within clade B3-400, apart from those within the cluster  and two other sequences, were also characterized by two additional amino acid mutations, 178T and 307 Furthermore, three of the clusters in which the sequences from Lombardy were included (D/L/S, Unnamed, and ) were also characterized by cluster-specific amino acid substitutions and additional substitutions were found in sub-clusters and single sequences, including a reversion to the original phenotype (400A). All mutations associated to the B3 sequences obtained in this study are listed in ). Within the 1346 considered H sequences we identified 242 sequences belonging to genotype D8, representing 18% of the total, and a phylogenetic tree was built with these sequences (shown  with the letters A, B, and C) and, while the three British sequences from 1994 were the only members of sub-clade B, the other two sub-clades included sequences identified in a similar time-frame (A: 2005&#x2013;2018; B: 2006&#x2013;2019). Except from the lack of African strains from the D8-400T, no differences were observed in terms of geographic origin as all groups contained strains from Asia (primarily India), Europe, and North America. ). Sequences from all individuals, independently from vaccination status, were found in all clusters. As before, we plotted on this tree amino acid substitutions associated to main branches and those identified specifically in the strains from Lombardy. Besides being characterized by the three substitutions defining the clade (400T, 416D, 560R), four additional mutations were observed in most sequences of sub-clade A (276L, 428V, 174T, 559V) and two were identified in all strains within sub-clade C (560K, 243E). Furthermore, the mutation 247P was exclusively associated to the cluster Unnamed and several cluster- and/or strain-specific substitutions were observed in all three clusters. Apart from four mutations found exclusively in four different strains from vaccinees (285G, 23T, 603R, 375Q), no specific substitution seemed to be associated to vaccination. All mutations associated to the D8 sequences from Lombardy are listed in ). To compare whether the variation at the level of the immune epitopes, with particular regard to residues 400 and 416, observed within genotypes B3 and D8 was also common to other genotypes, we assessed sequence conservation across each epitope and for each genotype using sequence logos (), while all other genotypes were principally characterized by a  Within , which was also highly conserved, the most variable site was residue 405. Interestingly, genotypes B3 and D8 were the only genotypes that showed a predominance of an amino acid different from A at position 400 and the only ones, together with D9, to show detectable variation at this site. In Italy, the first national measles elimination plan was implemented in 2003 and a two-dose schedule was introduced, starting with the 2002 birth cohort, with the first dose given at 12&#x2013;15 months of age and the second dose at 5&#x2013;6 years. To date, Italy is one of the 12 Member States where measles is considered to have remained endemic []. In Italy a rapid disappearance of several genotypes []. Viruses belonging to genotypes B3 and D8 have persisted globally with the circulation of numerous different strains. In Lombardy, the area of Northern of Italy considered by this investigation, genotypes D8 and B3 were detected for the first time in 2006&#x2013;2007 and 2005&#x2013;2006, respectively, and are currently co-circulating. Between 2015 and 2019, we observed the exclusive circulation of these two genotypes, which were mainly involved in autochthonous transmission. In this area, between 2017 and 2019 a total of 1363 cases of measles were recorded, going from 79 to 16.1 and 41.2 incidence rate per 1,000,000 inhabitants. These latest epidemics occurred despite an ever-increasing vaccine coverage. In fact, in 2017, measles vaccination was made mandatory for children up to the age of 16 years since, at a national level, the vaccination coverage was less than 92% for the first dose at 2 years of age. Since the careful sequence analysis of  H genes is crucial for understanding current epidemiological trends, in this study the H gene of  strains circulating between 2015 and 2019 in Lombardy were analyzed in order to evaluate the genetic variability of currently circulating variants of the two most diffused genotypes, B3 and D8, and to assess the conservation of the immunodominant sites. During this period, we observed the co-circulation of multiple different variants belonging to these two genotypes, referred to as -named strains and identified based on a short sequence of the ]. Overall, we observed the presence of four different B3 and three different D8 clusters, each one of them including sequences derived from viruses found in both vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Interestingly, apart from some mutations identified in single sequences, no relevant differences were observed within each cluster considering vaccination status. Although it is possible that infected vaccinees were actually non-responders [], this can also suggest that strains endemically circulating can infect vaccinated subjects, without requiring the acquisition of additional mutations. When we looked at the molecular epidemiology of these viruses in a global perspective, we noticed that all strains from Lombardy were included within broader clades characterized by the presence of amino acid mutations included within viral immune epitopes. In detail, B3 strains were all part of a clade within the sub-genotype B3.1 characterized by an amino acid substitution within the  (400V). This clade, which we named B3-400V, included about 62% of all B3 strains and all vaccine failures described in this study. Intriguingly, 126 of the 127 H sequences from all genotypes with that mutation were grouped in this clade. Furthermore, B3-400V included more recent sequences (2006&#x2013;2018) which were identified primarily in non-African countries, while all other B3 sequences were found predominantly in African countries and were characterized by an older detection date (1993&#x2013;2012). This is consistent with the proposed African origin of this genotype []. This substitution in recent strains and their circulation among vaccinated individuals may suggest that this substitution is advantageous for the virus. Since this mutation involves a site within the , further studies will be necessary to verify if this mutation may represent an antigenic drift. Similarly to what was observed for genotype B3, the vast majority of D8 sequences, about 88% and comprising all strains from Lombardy, were included in a single clade characterized by two amino acid mutations within immunogenic sites, 400T and 416 We named this clade D8-400 Additionally, D8-400T included more recently identified strains (2005&#x2013;2017) compared to the other D8 strains (1998&#x2013;2010); however, the geographic origin of the viruses was similar across the whole phylogeny with a predominance of Indian strains, but with a global distribution. This is consistent with an Asian origin for this genotype [] and suggests that mutated strains have recently replaced the original D8 viruses and are now spreading worldwide. Interestingly, within this group, we could identify three sub-clades and, while two of them included viruses currently circulating worldwide, another one included only three sequences detected exclusively in  in 1994 and seems, therefore, extinct. Two of these sub-clades presented further clade-characterizing amino acid substitutions, indicating a higher variability with respect to genotype B3 and the possible existence of sub-genotypes. One of the amino acid substitutions characterizing D8-400T sequences involved the same site within the  found mutated in most B3 sequences, residue 400. Threonine is a polar amino acid, more similar in size to alanine than valine [], whether these have the effect of reducing the effectiveness of vaccine-induced immune response will have to be demonstrated by in vitro assays and confirmed by broader molecular epidemiological investigations. It is however intriguing that the two genotypes that are the most prevalent worldwide, including in populations with high vaccination coverage rates, are the only two genotypes that show significant variation at this residue, as we showed when we compared sequence conservation at the level of the immune epitopes for each genotype. Overall, our data demonstrate the usefulness of  H gene sequencing. Furthermore, we identified that residue 400 within the H protein, a position that is located within the main immune epitope, is mutated in all strains for which the H sequence is available that belong to the two currently globally endemic genotypes, B3 and D8, which circulate among both unvaccinated and vaccinated subjects. Although the fixation of this mutation may suggest an advantage for these viruses, we were not able to determine whether it is associated to viral escape from vaccine-induced immunity and follow up experimental and epidemiological investigations will have to verify this hypothesis. Finally, we want to suggest that monitoring the H protein epitopes of circulating strains could be included in the measles laboratory surveillance activities in order to improve and optimize strategies for measles control, as countries go towards the elimination phase. The H gene of 73 strains, 34 belonging to genotype B3 and 39 to genotype D8, were sequenced during 2015&#x2013;2019 measles epidemics. Based on the ).

Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (Cs) and immune-related genes (s) are indispensable components of the tumor microenvironment and have been demonstrated to be highly valuable in determining the prognosis of multiple cancers. To elucidate the prognostic value of Cs and s in gastric cancer, we conducted a comprehensive analysis focusing on the abundances of 22 types of Cs and differentially expressed s based on a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (A). The results showed that great composition differences in Cs and immune cell subfractions were associated with survival outcomes in different stages. Additionally, 29 hub genes were characterized from 345 differentially expressed s and found to be significantly associated with survival outcomes. Then, an independent prognostic indicator based on ten s was successfully constructed after multivariate adjustment for some clinical parameters. Further validation revealed that these hub s could reflect the infiltration levels of immune cells. Thus, our results confirmed the clinical significance of Cs and s in gastric cancer and may establish a foundation for further exploring immune cell and gene targets for personalized treatment. tumor-infiltrating immune cells immune-related genes The Cancer Genome Atlas tumor microenvironment differentially expressed genes overall survival least absolute shrinkage and selection operator chimeric antigen receptor T cells natural killer tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes tumor associated macrophages regulatory T cells follicular helper T cells cytotoxic T lymphocyte  associated antigen 4 programmed death 1 extracellular regulated protein kinases false discovery rate receiver operating characteristic area under the  curve hazard ratio confidence interval Gene Ontology Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Gastric cancer is one of the most common human malignancies of the digestive system and ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, particularly in East Asia []. For advanced-stage patients, immunotherapy is considered to be one of the most promising treatments. Unfortunately, immunotherapies based on dendritic cells (s), chimeric antigen receptor T cells (-T cells) and immune checkpoints are not always effective due to tumor heterogeneity and the complicated tumor microenvironment (). Therefore, it is beneficial to study the deviations in the immune cell landscape for designing personalized treatment regimens or exploring new drug targets for gastric cancer. Innate immunity is an important first line of defense against infectious agents and tumors and consists of the immunological barrier, immune cells, and immune molecules. Natural killer () cells, macrophages, s, mast cells, eosinophils and neutrophils are the main innate immune cells. In cancer patients, tumor antigens can activate the body&#x2019;s adaptive immune response as the primary and decisive force in the elimination of tumors. Adaptive immunity is composed of two important branches: T cell-mediated cellular immunity and antibody-mediated humoral immunity. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (Cs) are indispensable components of the  and play important roles in tumorigenesis and progression. Thus, Cs have been widely applied for the clinical prediction of cancer treatment []. In recent years, large amounts of gene expression data for primary tumors from cancer patients have been collected. Newman et al. introduced  as an analytical method for characterizing the abundances of member cell types in a mixed cell population from their gene expression profiles []. However, the clinical relevance and prognostic significance of the immune cell composition and s in gastric cancer remain under exploration. In this study, the aim was to estimate the clinical implications of the C composition and s in gastric cancer. The transcriptomic -seq data were downloaded from the A database [] and the immune cell composition and its prognostic value in gastric cancer were investigated. Subsequently, the expression and prognostic landscape of survival-associated s were comprehensively analyzed and a prognostic signature was successfully constructed as an independent predictor for gastric cancer patients. The results of this study could provide promising insight for further exploiting biomarkers for the diagnosis and individualized treatment of gastric cancer based on Cs and s. The fraction of plasma cells was lower in gastric cancer than in normal tissue (, 2E, 2G, 2H). Thus, it is unlikely that a T cell-mediated antitumor immune response occurs in gastric cancer patients. &lt;0.001. &lt;0.01.

In addition, resting  cells, activated  cells, activated s, eosinophils and neutrophils did not differ between tumor and normal tissues. &lt;0.001. &lt;0.001.

The red and blue colours in the heatmap represent negative and positive correlations, respectively, between Cs and , while bubble size indicates the level of statistical significance. To further investigate the prognostic value of Cs, Cox regression analysis was applied to analyze the associations between overall survival () and immune cell subfractions in different stages of gastric cancer. As shown in &lt;0.01). Therefore, the correlation between Cs and  displayed great diversity among different stages. As s can reflect the immune status of cancer patients, we extracted s with differential expression in gastric cancer patients from transcriptomic -seq data for further analyses. First, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to identify differentially expressed genes (s) between gastric cancer and normal tissue. The results showed that a total of 6749 s were screened, including 5601 upregulated and 1148 downregulated genes (). ). Blue and red dots represent s, and black dots represent genes that were not differentially expressed. To create a valuable prognostic signature, univariate Cox analysis was conducted to screen s associated with the  of gastric cancer patients. In total, 100 genes were found to be significantly associated with clinical outcomes (). ) Prognostic value of hub genes.

To verify whether the constructed prognostic signature could function as an independent predictor, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were carried out and compared. The results showed that the prognostic signature was an independent predictor of the prognosis of gastric cancer patients after other parameters were adjusted, including age, sex, tumor grade and  stage (). ) Cox regression analyses of the gastric cancer cohort. To validate the relationships between s and Cs,  was used to visualize the correlations between the expression of hub s and the infiltrating levels of B cells, 8. ) and their associations with the infiltration levels of immune cells. Cancer is a genetic and immune-mediated disease, and tumor fate is shaped by the host immune system through the activation of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, named cancer immunoediting []. Gastric cancer has strong heterogeneity, and the treatment outcomes and prognosis are affected by tumor location, subtype, age, sex, etc. How to govern the strength and timing of antitumor responses are key problems that deserve careful consideration. Previous studies have proven that Cs are highly relevant to tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis. The interactions between Cs and tumor cells are considered to be directly associated with the physical destruction of the tumor cells, tumor burden reduction, and clinical prognosis improvement. An increasing number of studies, however, have suggested that tumor progression may be promoted by aberrant infiltration of immune cells []. Therefore, immune cells may play a dual role in stimulating antitumor immunity or promoting tumor development in cancer patients. In this study, the composition and prognostic value of Cs in gastric cancer patients were analyzed based on the deconvolution of bulk gene expression data from a large set of samples. We found that there were considerable differences in C compositions and that relatively high fractions of M2 macrophages, resting s and monocytes indicated relatively poor  for patients with gastric cancer. Macrophages are highly plastic cells that can be divided into classical M1 and alternative M2 phenotypes based on their function []. However, an increased number of M0 macrophages predicted relatively poor  in stage  tumors, indicating that circulating macrophages can be recruited into tumors to alter the  and promote tumor progression. Therefore, activation of macrophages with different properties in various microenvironments may reverse their function and our results further suggested that s could be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in gastric cancer. Probst et al. revealed that resting s could induce peripheral 8]. Thus, it is worthy of eosinophil research to understand how they operate in the , which will hopefully unearth new clues for cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, we found that relatively high proportions of Tfh cells and 8 T cells in the advanced patients. Thus, it may be difficult to stimulate the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in patients with advanced-stage gastric cancer, which may be related to the poor prognosis and high mortality of advanced patients. The  is correlated with the proliferation, invasion, metastasis and immune escape of tumor cells, in which tumor cells can induce immunosuppression by mimicking immune cells through  expression []. Thus, the investigation of s is particularly critical to provide more prognostic information and predict responses to therapy. By applying Wilcoxon signed-rank test and univariate Cox analysis, 29 hub s that were differentially expressed in gastric cancer and significantly associated with the  were identified. Then,  Cox regression analysis was conducted and ten hub s were ascertained to construct the formula for prognostic model. The  of the  curve reached 0.786. The correlations of  with age, sex, tumor grade,  stage and the risk score were analyzed and demonstrated the favorable clinical viability of the constructed model. Thus, an independent predictor was successfully modelled for outcome prediction, which could provide practical guidance to adjust treatment strategies and improve the antitumor immune responses of gastric cancer patients. In summary, the present study includes several  T cells was significantly associated with prolonged  Third, we calculated the prognostic value of s and built an independent predictor for gastric cancer patient outcome prediction. Ultimately, we substantiated the significant correlation between hub s and Cs and further confirmed the research significance of our analyses. These results may be helpful for improving immunotherapeutic regimens or enhancing antitumor immunity in gastric cancer patients. Transcriptomic -seq data for gastric cancer samples were downloaded from the A database, including data for 374 primary gastric cancer and 32 normal tissues.

() is a relevant pathogen for salmonid aquaculture worldwide. In 2015, a new genotype of  (genotype 3, -3) was discovered in Norway, and in 2017 -3 was detected for first time in Denmark in association with complex disease cases in rainbow trout in recirculating aquaculture systems (). To explore the epidemiology of -3 in Denmark, a surveillance study was conducted in 2017 to 2019. Fifty-three farms, including both flow through and , were screened for -3. Of the farms examined, -3 was detected in thirty-eight (71.7%), with the highest prevalence in grow-out farms. Notably, in Denmark disease outbreaks were only observed in . Additionally, wild Atlantic salmon and brown trout populations were included in the screening, and -3 was not detected in the three years where samples were obtained (2016, 2018, and 2019). Historical samples in the form of archived material at the Danish National Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases were also tested for the presence of -3, allowing us to establish that the virus has been present in Denmark at least since 1995. Sequence analyses of segment S1 and M2, as well as full genome analyses of selected isolates, did not reveal clear association between genetic makeup in these two segments and virulence in the form of disease outbreaks in the field.  ].  To describe the different levels of variation within  throughout this paper, the terminology genotype is used for -1, -2, and -3, and subtype to describe the groups within genotypes (e.g., -3a and -3b) []. To date, three genotypes of  have been characterized: -1, which has been shown to cause heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (I) in farmed Atlantic salmon (]. -3 was discovered in 2013 during the diagnostic investigation of an unexplained event of increased mortality in a flow through farm producing rainbow trout (]. Overall, ]. The first aim of this study is to assess the presence of -3 in Denmark, and to highlight risk factors involved in disease onset in fish farms. A voluntary surveillance program was conducted, where the presence of -3 was assessed in Danish farms for a one and a half year period. The program included both rainbow trout and brown trout farms, and farms in all different stages of production from hatchery to grow-out phase. The farms also included a whole range of water recirculation systems, from open flow through to intensive , covering all the different kinds of aquaculture production in Denmark. In order to backtrack the presence of the virus in the country, we also screened archived material of the Danish National Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases back to 1995. The full genome was sequenced for a small number of isolate representatives, both for recent and historical samples.  In an attempt to trace the spatio-temporal dynamics of -3 in Denmark, sequences from the S1 and M2 segment of -3 positive surveillance cases were obtained. These two segments were chosen because it has been suggested that virulence in -1 is linked to these segments []. Thus, the second aim of this study is to test whether this is also true for -3. A voluntary surveillance program targeting -3 was conducted in collaboration with the Danish Aquaculture Organisation (Dansk Akvakultur, Aarhus, Denmark) and private veterinarians. The program started in fall 2017 and finished in early spring 2019; it included 53 farms (30% of the 175 active Danish farms producing salmonids in the country in 2018). During the time span of the program, 75 samplings were carried out, and 2031 samples were analyzed for the presence of -3 by -q. In order to accommodate the large number of samples, a testing scheme was implemented in which samples were tested in pools consisting of five fish. The pooling effect on assay sensitivity was evaluated prior to start of the surveillance program (). At each sampling, heart and spleen were collected from around 30 fish individually (the number of fish sampled varied in some samplings). In addition, information about farm characteristics were recorded: production type (broodstock or production), type of water recirculation (from flow through to intensive recirculating aquaculture systems), presence of biofilters, fish species produced, age and history of the fish, and tank number, along with an assessment of the health status of the fish. The amount of information provided per case regarding the fish age, size, history and tank number varied from case to case, however. The program was organized in a way that the veterinarians could also submit samples from the same farm at different time points, as well as when increased mortality was recorded on the farm or when fish were showing clinical signs (i.e., abnormal swimming behaviour, increased gill movement etc.). After each sampling, results were made available to the fish farmers and the private veterinarian responsible for the sampling. Samples from wild salmonids (Atlantic salmon and sea trout) were obtained in 2016, 2018, and 2019 from Danish Centre for Wild Salmon (Danmarks Center for Vildlaks, ), of which all samples tested negative for -3 (tested as individual samples). Out of the 53 farms included in this study, 38 (71.7%) were positive for -3, although in three of them -3 was present at very low levels. In these three cases, results were corroborated by testing fish individually, revealing that only one or two fish out of 30 were positive with high Ct values (&#x2265;35 Ct). Importantly, only five farms have been tested negative across multiple samplings. As the surveillance program unveiled that -3 has a high prevalence in Denmark, it became necessary to investigate if the spread of the virus was natural (e.g., following a particular water catchment) or not. Mapping all farms included in the surveillance program revealed that there is no association between the geographical distribution and of the presence of -3. Furthermore, -3 is widespread within the most of the country, not following any clear phylogeographic pattern, as is expected by virus movement by trade of fish from one farm to another.  Water recirculation appear to increase the risk of a farm being positive for -3, as 100% of  farms with biofilters tested positive (18 out of 18), compared to 50% of flow through (11 out of 22, Fisher exact test b). To expand the knowledge on host susceptibility range and epidemiology, the study included testing of farms producing brown trout for restocking. Four out of five screened farms producing brown trout were positive. Two farms housed both rainbow trout and brown trout in their facilities. Interestingly, in one of these farms, only samples from rainbow trout were positive, while all samples from brown trout were negative for -3. While -3 has been detected in 38 of the farms included in the surveillance program, disease associated with detection of the virus has only been observed in 10 farms (approximately 26% of the positive farms). All the farms affected were  to different degrees. Disease has never been observed in association with -3 in flow through farms in Denmark, or in any of the brown trout farms included in the surveillance.  As -3 is more prevalent in Denmark than initially expected, investigation of archived material from 1995 was conducted. All the archived samples from 1995 ( = 29) representing fish tissue from 25 rainbow trout farms (covering broodstock, production, and sea cages) originate from diagnostic investigations where infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (v) was isolated in association with disease outbreaks. Eleven samples (38%) of these 1995 samples tested positive for -3.  For each -3 positive farms, only one pool with the highest viral load was sequenced per sampling.  Partial sequences of segment S1, encoding the &#x3C3;3 protein (outer capsid protein, zinc metalloprotein) [). Phylogenetic analyses of  have largely been based on the S1 segment and therefore a major representation of -3 sequences was available for this segment, including a number of Chilean -3 sequences isolated from rainbow trout and coho salmon in 2013 and 2014. As very few sequences of the segment M2 are available in public databases, the number of isolates in the M2 dataset is considerably smaller (71 -3 isolates in the S1 dataset, and 37 in the M2 dataset). a). Consistent with previously shown [a,b), it is clear that, at least in segments S1 and M2, there is not a direct association between sequence and disease, in the sense that no particular clade encompassed disease causing isolates only. This lack of correlation is evident as isolates causing disease are widely inter-dispersed along the phylogeny of -3, and isolates recovered from farms suffering severe disease outbreaks are identical to isolates from farms with no disease detected. No association between -3 genetic makeup and host species was detected either.  Additionally, no evidence of recombination was found within segment S1. In segment M2, weak evidence of recombination was found for sequence /060214 with 4 []. The current distribution and clustering of -3 isolates in the two segments is reflected also in the haplotype network analysis of (a, the haplotype corresponding to brown trout isolates /18-5020-3 and /18-6340-33 (haplotype 1), and the haplotype corresponding to sequence isolates from two vertically integrated companies /18-6518-30 and /18-4929-33 (haplotype 12), do not belong to the -3b clade, being quite different from other -3 isolates (/18-6340-33 and /18-5020-3 are identical, and the percent nucleotide identity is 96.2% and 95.7&#x2013;96.1% to -3a and -3b, respectively. /18-4929-33 has a percent nucleotide identity of 97.3% to -3a, and 88.3&#x2013;96.3% to -3b. Finally, for /18-6518-30 the nucleotide identity is 97.2% and 88.3&#x2013;96.2% to -3a and -3b, respectively), and may indicate a different introduction event of -3 within the country, or at least that two different genetic lineages are coexisting within the country. Complete full genomes were obtained for three Danish -3 isolates. To do so, and due to the lack of an in vitro replication method, infection experiments were done to propagate all -3 isolates subject to full genome sequencing in vivo. Full genome sequencing was done using two different methods. For the two samples from 2017 and 2018,  was isolated from plasma, and  was sequenced using on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system. In the case of the sample of 1995,  was extracted from serum, but here a sequencing independent single-primer amplification () method was used previous to library construction [] and sequencing in Illumina MiSeq. For the contemporary samples isolate /317 and /315, 156,819,216 reads and 105,445,446 reads were obtained, respectively (). Of those, only about 0.1% of the reads belonged to -3. De novo assembly, done with only 5% of the total data (7,840,890 and 5,272,273 reads, respectively), resulted in 1517 contigs for /315 (19 &gt; 1000 bp, N50 = 6), and 6935 contigs for /317 (43 &gt; 1000 bp, N50 = 14). For the historical sample of 1995, 1,280,914 reads were obtained of which 966,924 (0.75%) belonged to -3. The de novo assembly resulted in 50 contigs (14 &gt; 1000 bp, N50 = 5). The largest obtained contig had a length of 3982, corresponding to the L1 segment of -3. Full genome phylogenetic analyses of the three Danish -3 isolates were carried out including the two previously published -3 genomes from rainbow trout in Norway and from coho salmon in Chile (). Phylogenetic analyses performed on individual segments were relatively consistent (see ) (99% ). Whether this is caused by segment assortment needs to be explored further.  The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, distribution, and genetic variability of -3 in Denmark in order to (1) gain knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus, and assess whether there was a correlation between prevalence and type of farming system, and (2) whether there was a correlation between isolate sequence and disease as it has been suggested for -1. By testing 2031 samples representing 53 salmonid farms we demonstrated that -3 is widespread in Denmark. -3 was detected in fish farms encompassing flow through and a variety of different recirculating aquaculture systems. The prevalence measured was 71.7% of the farms tested, which represent 30.3% of the total amount of active salmonid farms in Denmark in 2018 (175 active farms). Notably, clinical disease outbreaks associated with the detection of -3 were seen in only 26% of the -3 positive farms (10 out of 38 positive farms). Three farms have, however, had disease associated with the detection of -3 on multiple occasions. The distribution of positive farms does not reflect a natural spread of the virus, as positive farms are located throughout most of the country. The most obvious explanation is related to the trade of live fish, which can be asymptomatic carriers (as is observed in fish testing positive for the virus without showing clinical disease). By molecular tracing, we could document that there has been known transport of fish from the farm associated with isolate /18-5650-58 to the farms associated with the isolates /18-3758-33, /18-4260-7, and /18-1766-19. These isolates are identical or very similar to each other, indicating that transport of contaminated and non-disinfected eggs or infected fish can equal transport of the virus. Our data showed a close relationship between type of production and presence of virus, as -3 related disease was only observed in rainbow trout produced under  conditions, and with 87% -3 positive production farms versus 47% positive broodstock farms, indicating that this virus primarily is a threat to the rapidly growing  industry. In Denmark, most broodstock farms are surveyed for the presence of  virus and , the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease (), in order to produce fish certified free for these pathogens. Therefore, it was a natural step to assess if -3 could be incorporated into this program for producing certified -3-free eyed eggs and progeny for trade. Unfortunately, some of the currently certified  and  free farms were positive for -3, nevertheless a number of broodstock farms are apparently still free, and might in future form the basis for stocking -3 free production farms, e.g., in fully recirculated aquacultures. Recently, a role of -3 in the development of  in brown trout has been suggested and discussed [], which so far has not been reported in Denmark. Importantly, in our study no signs of disease or mortality were observed in farms producing brown trout for restocking purposes despite findings of -3. As most of brown trout production is aimed for restocking rivers in Denmark, this host may however play a relevant role in maintaining the infection in the river environment, and further studies will be needed to investigate the spread of -3 in wild salmonid populations indigenous in Danish rivers.  Importantly, no -3 was detected in Atlantic salmon used as broodstock for re-stocking purposes from , these data are in agreement with what has been reported in Norway []. -3 is not prevalent in wild populations of Norwegian or Danish Atlantic salmon, and this possibly reflect a lower susceptibility of this host for -3. Due to limited sample size of sea trout tested in this study, no conclusion can be drawn on the prevalence of -3 in this salmonid species in Denmark. Interestingly, disease outbreaks consistent with the detection of -3 occurred exclusively in rainbow trout in farms with . Fish in  with biofilters seem to be at a greater risk of having -3, as 100% of the screened  farms with biofilters were positive, compared to 50% of farms with flow through systems. Additionally, disease was observed in 44% of -3 positive  farms with biofilter (8 out of 18 farms), while disease has not been observed in flow through farms yet. Previous experimental infection studies [a) is represented in the S1 tree by two different isolates collected at different time points. Since the sequencing of the isolates was done with the Sanger method on pooled samples during the surveillance, it is very likely that the co-circulation of different isolates occurs more often than indicated in our results, as we are only showing the most dominant sequence of the viral population at the farm at a given time point.  Six farms are represented by two to three isolates (]. It should also be considered that multiple factors such as water quality parameters, and presence of other agents might change the clinical picture observed at the farm.  -3 was first described in 2013 in association with clinical disease outbreak in rainbow trout in Norway [ has in general been circulating long before being associated with disease. In the case of -3, it is clear that the virus has circulated in Danish farms long before disease onset. One hypothesis to be examined is that the cause of the sudden association with disease could be linked to a more virulent genotype becoming more prevalent. Our data, however, does not support this hypothesis.  In an attempt to identify virulence markers associated with different -1 strains, Dhamotharan et al. [). Furthermore, sequences of Danish isolates from 1995 are identical to the current surveillance isolates in both segments, indicating that the virus has changed very little in the last 23 years. This could further support that the presence of -3 is necessary but not sufficient to trigger disease, and that other environmental, epidemiological, and host factors are needed to cause a disease outbreak.  Previous studies have defined two subtypes of -3 based on S1 segment phylogeny, namely -3a which is found in Norway, and -3b which is found in the rest of Europe and Chile [b), as the Norwegian isolates form a separate clade from all other isolates. Four Danish isolates included in this study do not fit the current subtyping particularly for the S1 segment. This includes /18-4929-33 and /18-6518-30 from rainbow trout, and /18-6340-33 and /18-5020-3 from brown trout farmed for restocking purposes. Interestingly, /18-4929-33 and /18-6518-30 are isolates belonging to two farm sites of vertically integrated companies. These sites do not introduce eggs and/or fish from other farms. As for their position in the phylogeny, it is possible to speculate about the origin of these two -3 isolates, and whether this constitutes a separate introduction of -3 in Denmark.  Analyses of -3 full genomes reveal that L2 is the most variable  segment within -3 genome. Furthermore, L2 is the only  segment, which shows higher variability in -3 compared to -1. Conversely, segments M2, M3 and S1 () are more variable in -1 compared to -3, but all these results have the caveat that our limited sampling of -1 may not be the best to perform this kind of comparisons.  The L2 segment encodes for lambda 2 protein, the turret protein protruding around the fivefold axes in the core particles []. This may indicate that the L2 segment could harbour interesting features associated with virulence in other reoviruses, opening for further examination of . Moreover, being the most variable segment within -3 genome, L2 represent an interesting target for phylogenetic analysis, molecular tracing and study on the evolution of the virus. Further studies should compare the impact of different -3 subtypes in rainbow trout and expand knowledge on pathogen independent factors which enhance disease outbreak.  The samples included in this study were obtained from a voluntary targeted surveillance program conducted in 53 Danish aquaculture facilities from late 2017 to early 2019 across 75 samplings.  The farms included in the program covered a wide variety of aquaculture farms in Denmark, encompassing flow through to fully recirculating aquaculture system. Additionally, farms producing both rainbow trout and/or brown trout were included. For each sampling, fish displaying clinical signs were selected. If no such fish were present at the time of sampling, healthy fish were selected instead. On average 30 fish were collected at each farm, and sampled individually. Pieces of heart and spleen from each specimen were pooled in tubes with 500 &#xB5;L later, and shipped to the laboratory cold.  Statistical analysis of the test results was performed with Fisher exact test. Archived material stored in the freezers of  Aqua, Unit for Fish and Shellfish Disease in Lyngby, Denmark was selected for testing for -3. The material consisted of organ homogenate for virological examination collected during clinical disease outbreaks with Vin 1995. According to standard operating procedure in the lab, these consisted of a pool of organs (heart, spleen and kidney) from 10 fish homogenized, diluted in  1:10, and stored at &#x2212;80 &#xB0;  Additionally, -3 positive samples obtained during a survey in Norway in 2016 [] were included in our analyses. The samples consisted of heart and spleen from individual fish preserved in later. Finally, individual wild fish used as broodstock for re-stocking purposes were obtained from Danish Center for Wild Salmon () in 2016, 2018 and 2018. Pooled organs (heart, kidney and spleen tissues) from individual Atlantic salmon () were screened for -3 by q. Seven sea trout were tested in 2016; 100 Atlantic salmon in 2018, and 30 Atlantic salmon in 2019.  purification from heart and spleen in later was done with easy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cube (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations.  Real-time -q for detection of -3 was done as previously described [], using QuantiTect Probe - kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations in a final volume of 25 &#xB5;L with 5 &#xB5;L template. ase-free water was used as negative  control. -q was performed using Stratagene Mx3000P and Mx3005 Data was analyzed in MxPro software (v4.10 build 389, Schema 85, 2007 Stratagene). Cut-off value for positive samples was set at Ct 37. Samples with a Ct &gt; 37 with a sigmoidal shape of the amplification plot were considered suspect. If the amplification plot had a non-sigmoidal shape and Ct &gt; 37, such samples were considered negative. Threshold was set at 0.01 fluorescence (dRn) at a logarithmic y-axis.  Prior to implementing the diagnostic protocol with 5-fish pools, the sensitivity of testing pooled samples was assessed by pooling samples containing different loads of viral  with negative samples (see ). Tissue lysis was done on individual samples, and the lysate was pooled for  extraction. Four types of samples representing strong positive (Ct 18.6-19.8), weak positive (Ct 33.9-35.4), suspect (Ct 37.4-37.5), and negative were included in the testing. Briefly, each sample type was tested after being diluted in the following ratios (v:v): undiluted, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, and 1:9.  was purified with easy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using cube (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. Pooling of material from 5 fish were decided upon for general surveillance and to allow for subsequent &#x201C;de-pooling&#x201D;, individual fish tissue lysates were stored on lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at &#x2013;80 &#xB0; If a pooled sample was recovered with very high Ct value or in cases of dubious q results, samples were de-pooled and tested individually.  For the majority of cases, fish samples belonging to the surveillance program were analyzed in 5-fish pools. Samples obtained from the Norwegian survey and wild salmonids were analyzed as individual fish samples. Sequencing of S1 was performed using Qiagen OneStep - Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations with 5 &#xB5;L of template. The primers used are described in . Thermal cycler conditions: 50 &#xB0;C for 30 min, 95 &#xB0;C for 15 min, (94 &#xB0;C for 30 s, 70 &#xB0;C for 30 s (&#x2212;0.5 &#xB0;C per cycle), 72 &#xB0;C for 1 min) for 30 cycles, (94 &#xB0;C for 30 s, 55 &#xB0;C for 30 s, 72 &#xB0;C for 1 min) for 30 cycles, 72 &#xB0;C for 10 min. Thermal cycler: MiniAmp and MiniAmpPlus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, , ). Sequencing of M2 was done similarly to S1 segment, but combining sequencing primers for (1) two partially overlapping amplicons for surveillance samples, and (2) five partially overlapping amplicons for archived samples. The primers used are described in . Thermal cycler conditions: 50 &#xB0;C for 30 min, 95 &#xB0;C for 15 min, (94 &#xB0;C for 30 s, 70 &#xB0;C for 30 s (&#x2212;0.5 &#xB0;C per cycle), 72 &#xB0;C for 1 min and 20 s) for 30 cycles, (94 &#xB0;C for 30 s, 55 &#xB0;C for 30 s, 72 &#xB0;C for 1 min and 20 s) for 30 cycles, 72 &#xB0;C for 10 min.  products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% (S1) and 2% (M2) E-gels (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, , ) using E-gel powerbase version 4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, , ) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations.  was purified with either quick  Purification Kit of quick Gel Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. Sanger sequencing were performed by Eurofins genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) using the same primers as described in .  For phylogenetic reconstruction, the S1 dataset consisted of 79 sequences of 774 nt (including seven -1 and one -2 sequences as outgroup), the M2 dataset consisted of 44 sequences of 1913 nt (including six -1 and one -2 sequences as outgroup).  Dataset were aligned using Muscle v. 3.8.425 (]), with standard settings, as implemented in Geneoius Prime v. 2020.1. The presence of recombination was tested using 4 v. 1.00 [). No evidence of recombination was found within segment S1 with either method. In M2, weak evidence of recombination was found for sequence /060214 with 4, but this was not corroborated with  The best fitting model of substitution, as indicated as the model with the lowest  score (Bayesian Information criterion), was estimated in Mega X [] for each dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were carried on using the program Phy v. 3.2.2 (] was used Four categories were used for the rate heterogeneity, and Phy freely estimated the gamma model parameters, number of invariable sites, and other parameters of the model. Branch support was estimated by non-parametric bootstrap with 100 repetitions in Phy A  phylogenetic tree was also reconstructed using Rax as implemented in Geneious Prime v. 2020.1.1 using the +G model and standard settings with 1000  replicates.  Haplotype networks of the S1 and M2 segment were generated using Pop Art [], using minimum spanning network (&#x3B5; = 0). Full genome sequence was done in two recent isolates associated with diseases. Isolate /18-3659-17 was previously isolated in Nov 2017, and isolate /18-3659-15 in March 2018. Both isolates were present in two rainbow trout farms suffering a heavy onset of disease.  An in vivo challenge trial was conducted to propagate in rainbow trout -3 isolates from disease outbreaks as described in Dhamotharan et al. [. In vivo experimental trial to propagate -3 was conducted following guidelines for welfare of research animals under license number 2013-15-2934-00976.  Full genome sequencing was carried out for one of the historical samples from 1995. This sample consisted of a pool of organs from rainbow trout homogenized in  for virological examination as prescribed by standard operating procedures for virological examination on cell culture (currently given in Commission Implementing Decision 2015/1554/). The organ homogenate was stored at &#x2212;80 &#xB0;C for 23 years. In order to propagate the virus, 800 &#xB5;L of the original sample were mixed with 800 &#xB5;L anti- (Anti- , Immunological and Biochemical Testsystems, Binzwangen, Germany and 40 &#xB5;L gentamycin (Life technologies, Carlsbad, , ) and stored at 4 &#xB0;C overnight, and used next day as inoculum for viral propagation in rainbow trout.  Viral propagation was done using 15 juvenile rainbow trout (50 g) challenged intraperitoneally with 100 &#xB5;L inoculum each. In vivo experimental trial to propagate -3 was conducted following guidelines for welfare of research animals under license number 2019-15-0201-00159.  Fish were kept in a 180 L tank at 12 &#xB0;C temperature. Non-lethal blood samples were collected from the caudal vein after anaesthesia of fish (80 mg/L of benxocaine) and viral load assessed by q. At the peak of viremia, fish were euthanized (overdose of benzocaine 800 mg/L) and bleed. Blood samples without anticoagulant, and organ samples in  were collected. Organ samples were immediately stored at &#x2212;80 &#xB0; In order to minimise host genetic material, serum was separated from the whole blood, and 280 &#xB5;L of each serum sample was diluted in the corresponding volume of -Carrier- buffer from the amp Viral  Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) before storage at &#x2212;80 &#xB0;  was extracted from serum samples using the amp Viral  Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations.  was eluted in 60 &#xB5;L buffer .  removal from the eluted  (60 &#xB5;L) was done using -free  Removal Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, , ) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. A sequencing independent single-primer amplification () method was used according to Mohr et al., 2015 with modifications. In brief, first strand c was generated from a 7 &#xB5;L of the sample using the SuperScript]. Lastly,  products were purified using quick  Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. Libraries were prepared with the Nextera   Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, , ) and sequenced with MiSeq v3 Reagent Kit (300) using Illumina MiSeq platform. Sixteen sample libraries were pooled equimolarly, of which only one corresponded to -3. Both library preparation and sequencing were done at  core sequencing facilities.  Cleaning and removal of Nextera adapters from the Illumina MiSeq raw data using uk: Adapter/Quality Trimming and Filtering version 38.97., part of the ools package (), allowing up to 5 mismatches.  The de novo assembly was performed using Spades v. 3.13.0 (] to identify the different segments. Re-mapping of raw sequences to contigs from the de novo assembling was done using ap version 38.37, part of the ools package, with, Kmer = 13. Annotations were transferred to the final contig by similitude &gt; 95% to the reference sequence /060214.  Phylogenetic analyses were performed including the three full genomes reported in this study, together with the only two full genomes of -3 available in public databases []. Phylogenetic analyses were done for each segment independently, and in a concatenated matrix of all ten segments. As many of the sequences were short in the segments ends, phylogenetic analyses were done including coding regions only.  Dataset were aligned using Muscle v. 3.8.425 (. Average genetic distance within group (-1 and -3) were calculated with Mega X [] for each individual segment. The surveillance program conducted in Denmark in 2017 to 2019 revealed that there is a high prevalence of -3 in Danish aquaculture. The virus is widespread within the country, and does not follow a natural pattern, as is expected by virus movement related to trade of live fish and eggs. Recirculating aquaculture systems and grow-out facilities seem to be at a greater risk of having -3. Importantly, disease associated to -3 has only been observed in  in Denmark, and disease has not been observed in any brown trout tested in the surveillance program despite findings of the virus. Additionally, -3 has not been detected in wild populations of brown tout or Atlantic salmon. In order to backtrack -3 in Denmark, samples from diagnostic cases from 1995 were tested for -3, showing that -3 has been present in Danish aquaculture since at least 1995. Phylogenetic analyses of segments S1 and M2 supports that there are two subtypes of -3, with -3a and -3b being found in Norway and in Europe and Chile, respectively. Importantly, these two segments do not reveal any direct association between sequence and disease. Sequences from samples from 1995 are also identical to the contemporary sequence isolates, indicating that the virus has not changed much in these two segments for the past 23 years, further supporting that external factors are necessary for the development of disease. Importantly, the virus has been circulating long before the association with disease, and while it could be that the cause of sudden association with disease may be linked to a more virulent genotype becoming prevalent, our data does not support such a hypothesis.  We want to acknowledge Simon  Madsen, Thomas Clausen, and Torsten Boutrup for sampling and acquiring information on the farms participating in the surveillance. Furthermore, we appreciate the support of Danish Centre for Wild Salmon for providing samples from wild fish. Thank you to Torfinn Moldal at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute for supplying samples from Norwegian rainbow trout positive for -3.

The aim of this study was to develop a novel immune prognostic model of the  in lung adenocarcinoma.  First, the immune and stromal scores among lung adenocarcinoma patients were determined using the  algorithm in accordance with The Cancer Genome Atlas (A) database. Differentially expressed immune-related genes (s) between high and low immune/stromal score groups were analyzed, and a univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify s significantly correlated with overall survival () among patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () regression analysis was performed to generate -related immune prognostic signatures. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the mechanisms underlying these immune prognostic signatures. Finally, the functions of hub s were further analyzed to delineate the potential prognostic mechanisms in comprehensive A datasets.  were considered novel prognostic biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma. These hub genes had different mutation frequencies and forms in lung adenocarcinoma and participated in different signaling pathways. More importantly, these hub genes were significantly correlated with the infiltration of 4+ T cells, 8+ T cells, macrophages, B cells, and neutrophils.  The robust novel -related immune prognostic signature effectively predicted the prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Further studies are required to further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of these hub s in the  and to develop new treatment strategies. Lung cancer is still the leading disease worldwide in terms of the threat to human life and health (). Therefore, it is essential to understand the immune prognostic signature of lung adenocarcinoma. Previous studies have investigated the prognostic role of immune-related genes (s) in lung adenocarcinoma from the ImmPort database (), as the primary nontumor components of the , play a significant role in lung cancer prognosis. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the association between the  and lung adenocarcinoma prognosis. The development of a prognostic model of s based on the  might provide novel insights into the generation of a more accurate prognostic system. Accurate management and appropriate personalized therapies for lung adenocarcinoma are required in accordance with prognostic stratification. Moreover, an enhanced understanding of s involved in the  would help elucidate their regulatory mechanisms in the  and develop new treatment strategies. With advancements in machine learning, the  algorithm has been used to investigate s in the , based on the immune and stromal scores of the , and to generate a -related immune prognostic model (). Moreover, this algorithm can effectively predict the prognosis of patients with various cancers. Accordingly, in this study, we determined the immune and stromal scores of tumors using the  algorithm and developed a novel -related immune prognostic model of lung adenocarcinoma. Normalization of  sequence data, in terms of level 3 fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (M) reads, was performed for 594 samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (A) database, including 535 adenocarcinoma and 59 normal lung samples, before December 15, 2019. Thereafter, the Ensemble s were converted to gene symbols in accordance with human gene annotations. Furthermore, clinical data of lung adenocarcinoma patients were obtained and merged into a single matrix for subsequent analysis. Patients with an incomplete follow-up duration or recorded date of death of any cause were excluded. Finally, 494 lung adenocarcinoma patients with expression profiles and clinical data were included. Estimation of romal and Immune cells in lignant Tumor tissues using Expression data () is a tool for predicting and estimating infiltrating immune and stromal cells in tumor tissues based on gene expression profiles. Herein, the  algorithm was used to analyze the characteristics of specific gene expression in immune and stromal cells for each tumor sample to predict their immune and stromal scores. Thereafter, the immune and stromal scores were analyzed using the estimate package in R software. Based on the median immune and stromal scores, patients with lung adenocarcinoma were divided into two groups: high and low immune/stromal score groups. Significant differences in  between the high and low immune/stromal score groups were analyzed. On the basis of the significant differences in patient prognosis, differentially expressed s between the two groups were assessed using the Limma package in R software. Finally, intersecting differentially expressed s in both groups were considered for further analysis. A log(fold change) of &gt;2 and an adjusted -value of &lt;0.05 were considered cutoffs. Heat maps and Venn diagrams were generated using  Gene Ontology () and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (G) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to understand gene functional annotation and functional enrichment, respectively. Common differentially expressed s of  and G annotation were performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (), an online database (-value of &lt;0.05 indicated the significance of  terms and G pathway enrichment in genes herein. Furthermore, the top 10  terms and G pathway enrichment results were mapped using Hmisc and ggplot2 in R software. A total of 494 patients with lung adenocarcinoma in the A dataset were randomly divided into a training set and testing set at a ratio of 7:3 (training cohort, 346 patients; testing cohort, 148 patients). First, univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to screen out prognostic s in the training cohort (iteration = 1,000), with  &lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Second, the key s were further selected from among significant prognostic s on univariate analysis, through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () regression, a powerful tool for developing refined prognostic models, fitting generalized linear models, selecting variables, and regularizing complexity, using R software. Key s were subjected to multivariate Cox regression analysis. Finally, the risk score formula was developed in accordance with the key s identified through  analysis. After the expression value of each specific gene was included, the risk score formula for each patient was weighted by its estimated regression coefficient on  regression analysis. On the basis of the best separation of risk score, patients were divided into high-risk-score and low-risk-score groups. Survival differences between the two groups were assessed by Kaplan&#x2013;Meier survival curves using log-rank tests.  curves were used to assess the accuracy of model prediction. Furthermore,  regression analysis was performed to examine the role of the risk score in predicting clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the association between risk score and clinical stage was analyzed. To further determine whether the independent prognostic model could be used as an independent prognostic factor, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to analyze the predictive value of age, sex, stage,  stage, and predictive model. In the univariate analysis, the correlation between some independent variables and dependent variables was considered, and some correlations might be masked by the influence of confounding factors. To avoid omitting important predictors of prognosis, the threshold in univariate analysis was relaxed to -value in multivariate analysis was still 0.05. To investigate the differences in the putative mechanism between the high-risk-score and low-risk-score groups, gene set enrichment analysis (A) was performed to comprehensively analyze the differences in function enrichment. A is a computational method of determining whether an a priori defined set of genes is significantly different between two biological states. The number of permutations was set to 1,000, and the permutation type was set to phenotype. In this study, all genes in the training set were sequenced according to the degree of differential expression in the high-risk-score group and the low-risk-score group. A was used to comprehensively analyze differences in gene pathway enrichment between the two groups. The prognostic model was further validated for the testing cohort ( = 148). Similarly, the risk score of each patient was weighted on the basis of the risk score. Thereafter, based on the best separation of the risk score, patients in the testing cohort were divided into high-risk-score and low-risk-score groups. A Kaplan&#x2013;Meier survival curve and  curve analysis were performed in the testing however. To further analyze the mutation characteristics and the putative functional mechanisms of these hub s in lung adenocarcinoma, gene expression profiles of patients with lung adenocarcinoma were imported from the following datasets: A database (Broad, Cell 2012), Lung Adenocarcinoma (, Science 2015), Lung Adenocarcinoma (A, Firehose Legacy), Lung Adenocarcinoma (, Nature 2008), and Non-Small-Cell Cancer (, Cancer Discov 2017). A combined study of five datasets including 1,825 patients were included in this study. ite is an online cancer genomic analysis tool that integrates cancer genomics data for 33 cancer types from the A and normal tissue data from x (), enabling gene set pathway analysis in data analysis. In this study, ite was used to analyze the pathway of hub genes. The  database is a comprehensive tool for analyzing the immune cell infiltrates in tumors. The abundances of six immune infiltrates (B cells, 4+ T cells, 8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells) were estimated using the  algorithm. In this study, the  database was further applied to analyze the correlation between hub genes and immune cells. The correlation of hub gene expression with immune infiltration level was visualized in lung adenocarcinoma using the Gene module. The scatterplots were generated and displayed after hub genes and cancer type were submitted successfully, showing the purity-corrected partial Spearman's correlation and statistical significance. All statistical analyses were conducted with the R language (version 3.6.1). All statistical tests were bilateral, and  &lt; 0.05 was statistically significant. A total of 594 samples were obtained, including 535 adenocarcinoma and 59 normal lung samples. Data for a total of 494 lung adenocarcinoma patients with clinical information were retrieved (.

Additionally, the risk curve indicated that the high-risk-score group had a higher mortality and worse prognosis than the low-risk-score group (cutoff value: 0.889; ).

In this study, the possible molecular mechanisms of the prognosis difference between the two groups of patients were analyzed by A analysis.

First, the mutation characteristics of these hub s were analyzed among patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The mutation rates of these hub s in patients with lung adenocarcinoma were 0.8, 1, and 2.6% (). Mechanism analysis of hub genes in the A database.  The relationship between copy number variation () of hub genes and immune cell infiltration was further analyzed. In addition, analysis of pathways in the ite database revealed that C17A is primarily involved in the activation of the epithelial&#x2013;mesenchymal transition () and  pathways and cell cycle inhibition. A is primarily involved in the activation of the m pathway and inhibition of the apoptosis pathway. P1 was mainly involved in the activation of the apoptosis and the  pathways and inhibition of the  damage and the 3K pathways (). Finally, the  database was used to analyze the correlation between hub s and immune cells. The results showed that these key genes were significantly correlated with the infiltration of 4+ T cells, 8+ T cells, macrophages, B cells, and neutrophils. Assuming that a correlation coefficient &gt;0.3 was considered a strong correlation, further analysis showed that C17A was positively correlated with the infiltration of B cells and 4+ T cells. However, A was negatively correlated with the infiltration of 8+ T and dendritic cells. However, there was no strong correlation between P1 and the infiltration of immune cells (). Tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the  significantly contribute to the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, it is essential to develop a -related immune prognostic model for appropriate clinical management of lung adenocarcinoma. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to develop a novel -related immune prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma. Although some studies have explored the prognostic value of -related s in lung adenocarcinoma, certain key issues of these models remain to be resolved. Yang et al. () used the  algorithm to investigate the -related immune prognostic characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma. However, they directly enumerated immune and stromal cells from their expression profiles of all genes expressed in lung adenocarcinoma and normal tissues. Moreover, differentially expressed s were analyzed using Wilcoxon correlation analysis between tumor and normal tissue. However, some limitations are associated with the analysis of multi-dimensional tumor gene expression profiles through the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. These findings indicate that these -related prognostic immunity-based models have not been adequately evaluated. These issues can be resolved primarily by improving the algorithm of s in the  and to identify more specific -related s for lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, it is essential to develop a new -related immune prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma. To address these aforementioned limitations, in the present study, a new method was developed to identify differentially expressed s. First, -related differentially expressed s were identified exclusively from tumor samples by evaluating tumor-infiltrating immune cells and stromal cells via the  algorithm; this probably effectively reflected the -related s in tumor tissue. Second, differentially expressed s were analyzed on the basis of significant differences in  between the high- and low-immune-score groups in terms of lung adenocarcinoma, rather than differences between lung adenocarcinoma and normal tissue using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The prognostic model, based on prognosis-associated differentially expressed genes, might more accurately predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, intersecting differentially expressed s with significant prognostic characteristics in both immune and stromal scores were used for subsequent analysis. Both immune cells and stromal cells in each tumor sample were assessed, thus better reflecting the characteristics of the . Therefore, the -related immune prognostic model developed herein was different from those developed previously. In this study, we developed a more robust prognostic model of -related s in lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, this study shows that patients with lung adenocarcinoma and high immune scores had a better prognosis than those with low immune scores, which might be due to the involvement of upregulated s in immune cell infiltration factors, such as cytokines and B cell immune pathways. Clinical studies have also shown that lung cancer patients with high immune infiltration of helper T cells have a better prognosis than those with low infiltration (). These studies have suggested that certain cytokines are involved in antitumor immune pathways, potentially elucidating the mechanisms associated with prognosis. Moreover, A was performed to further investigate the potential mechanism underlying the differences in prognosis between the two groups. The present results indicate that the immunoregulation and immune cell activation pathways are potentially associated with a better prognosis. The underlying putative mechanism potentially involves the enrichment of B and T cell immune pathways. Furthermore, the infiltration of these immune cells is associated with an enhanced prognosis among patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Our results are concurrent with those of the aforementioned studies. Furthermore, this study described the functional prediction of potential hub s. An enhanced understanding of these potential hub genes is essential to elucidate their mechanisms of action in the  in lung adenocarcinoma. The present results suggest that although these genes were prognosis-related s, they harbored different mutations involved in different pathways in lung adenocarcinoma, indicating their potential involvement in different immunoregulatory pathways in lung adenocarcinoma. Further analysis of the function of these genes revealed that these hub genes and their s were different. Moreover, the association between these hub genes and the infiltration of B cells, 4+ T cells, 8+ T cells, neutrophils, and other immune cells was also different. These results indicate that different s of these hub genes warrant further differentiation to better understand the association between hub genes and immune cell infiltration. Based on the aforementioned results, our results indicate that  are potential novel biomarkers for the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. C17A is a human lectin found in lymph node B cells and is involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell adhesion, intercellular interactions, and pathogen recognition (). Further studies are required to elucidate the roles of these hub genes in the  in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma. This study also had some limitations. First, this study only mined data in the A database and did not combine  database analysis. However, in our study, patient data were segregated into training and testing cohorts. In addition, the results were verified and analyzed in comprehensive A and ite datasets. Second, the function of the hub gene in our study was analyzed based on the A database, and the validation function of the hub gene needs to be further confirmed by basic experiments. Constructing an immune-related prognosis model was the focus of our research; hence, there was no basic experiment on hub prognostic genes. Third, our study only analyzed the correlation of differentially expressed s with immune cell infiltration, thus lacking the correlation analysis of the expression of 1 and tumor mutational burden. The robust -related immune prognostic model developed herein effectively predicted the prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, thus potentially guiding personalized treatment of lung adenocarcinoma in accordance with prognostic stratification. Further studies are required to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of these s in the  and develop new treatment strategies. Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

However, the prognostic value of autophagy-related genes (s) for C still remains unclear. Our study set out to develop a multigene expression signature based on s for individualized prognosis assessment in C patients. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (A) database, we identified prognosis-related s through univariate  regression analysis. Then we performed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () regression analysis to identify an optimal autophagy-related multigene signature with the subsequent validation in testing set, 41613 and 42743 datasets. We identified 36 prognosis-related s for  Subsequently, the multigene signature based on 13 prognostic s was constructed and successfully divided C patients into low and high-risk groups with significantly different overall survival in A training set (&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.0001). The autophagy signature remained as an independent prognostic factor for C in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.

Therefore, it is an urgent need to establish reliable prognostic biomarkers to help clinicians optimize and personalize treatment strategies. Autophagy is a multi-step process by which damaged cellular components are transferred to lysosomes for degradation, resulting in nutrient cycling and metabolic adaptation (). A remarkable number of studies have demonstrated the relationship between autophagy and  For instance, a recent study indicated that autophagy helped maintain the stemness and promoted drug tolerance in C (). To date, studies using large-scale expression patterns of s to screen and develop molecular biomarkers and prognostic gene signature for C are still lacking. The workflow of the study for constructing the autophagy-related prognostic signature and nomogram in oral squamous cell carcinoma. A, The Cancer Genome Atlas; C, oral squamous cell carcinoma; , the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. A total of 222 s were retrieved from the Human Autophagy Database (b, ), a database providing a comprehensive and updated list of s of human being. All primitive -seq datasets and clinical information of C patients were downloaded and extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (A, ) databases. In total, 305 C samples were enrolled in our A cohort. And then, A-C patients with complete clinical information were split into a training set (154 C patients) and a testing set (internal validation set, 65 C patients) randomly and homogeneously. Finally, 41613 (external validation set1, 96 C patients) and 42743 (external validation set2, 68 C patients) datasets were obtained from the  database for the validation studies. Univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify the s significantly correlated with the overall survival () in A-C cohort, using the survival package. These identified prognosis-related genes were used for subsequent construction of multigene signature. Then, we conducted  Cox regression analysis to establish a prognostic multigene signature in training set with the pool of candidate prognosis-related s. The aforementioned procedures were implemented with the glmnet package. According to the expression values of each sample,  chooses the qualified prognostic genes to further calculate the risk score and assigns corresponding coefficient to each prognostic gene. The risk score of each patient was calculated with the following formula: ). The optimal cutoff value of the risk score was identified using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic () analysis with survival  package. Afterwards, all C patients in training set were separated into high-risk (with high risk score) and low-risk (with low risk score) groups by the cutoff point. Survival differences between the two groups were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve and compared by log-rank test. In order to assess the predictive accuracy of the prognostic signature, time-dependent  curves for 1, 3, and 5-year survival were constructed and the area under the curve () values were calculated with the survival  package. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses for  were applied to compare the prognostic relevance between the autophagy signature and other clinical factors (including age, gender, stage, T-stage, N-stage, smoking, and alcohol history) in A training set. Finally, we used A testing set as well as two  cohorts (41613 and 42743 sets) as internal and external validation sets to examine the universality and reliability of the gene signature by a similar approach. The same formula and the same cutoff value were used in the risk score calculation and subsequent groups division in the three validation sets. All the prognostic genes involved in our signature were subjected to  and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (G) analysis to explore the associated biological characteristics and potential signaling pathways. Next, we used these genes to establish a protein-protein interaction () network by the  database () and the  network was then visualized through Cytoscape (Version 3.6.1) software. Moreover, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssA) was conducted to uncover the differentially enriched signaling pathways between low and high-risk groups. First, A package and its ssA method were used to calculate the enrichment score of each sample on different gene sets. Then significantly differentially enriched gene sets between low and high-risk groups were identified using the limma package and the top 30 of these gene sets were displayed by heat map. Moreover, we performed Pearson&#x2019;s correlation analysis using the corrplot package in order to confirm the correlation between these pathways and the risk score. To estimate the probability of 3- and 5-year survival for C patients, we used age, gender, stage, tobacco history, alcohol history, and risk score to construct a nomogram in training set, ). Additionally, we quantitatively evaluated the prediction performance of the nomogram by the concordance index (C-index). Finally, the prognostic nomogram was internally verified in A testing set in the same way. All statistical analyses were conducted using the R software (version 3.6.2). Two-sided t test was used to check the relationship between the risk score and clinical features. Survival curves were plotted by the K-M method and assessed with log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.

C is a progressive disease with heterogeneous prognosis and high mortality rate, and thus accurate prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed to improve prognosis assessment and individualized treatment (). In this study, we mined the existing -seq expression data of C to screen prognosis-related s and establish a multigene expression signature from the view of autophagy for the first time. Our results show that an s-based prognostic signature can be applied for prognosis stratification in C patients, which will contribute to individualized treatment and shed new light on autophagy targeting therapies. In this study, we extracted the m expression data of 222 s in A-C cohort and developed a 13-s prognostic signature using  regression analysis. K-M curves indicated that the gene signature could successfully divide C patients into low and high-risk groups with significantly different  Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that the gene signature could be an independent prognostic factor for  The  analysis also indicated a better prediction performance of our gene signature compared with other clinical risk factors. Additionally, the prognostic power of our gene signature could be validated in independent  datasets and internal testing set, indicating favorable universality and reliability. In order to achieve better predictive performance, we combined the gene signature with multiple clinical risk factors (age, gender, -stage, tobacco, and alcohol history) to establish a nomogram to quantitatively estimate survival probability for  Calibration plots demonstrated favorable consistency between actual and predicted survival both in training set and testing set. Thus, our gene signature and nomogram may provide an accurate and reliable prediction approach for the prognosis of C patients and help clinicians optimize and personalize treatment strategies. Among these 13 s in our prognostic gene signature, most of them have been reported to be closely associated with the development and prognosis of C or other malignancies. 13A, 45, and 24 are vital components of the autophagy machinery. Prior study has noted that 13A expression was suppressed in many tumor cell lines, which suggested that it might be highly linked to the tumorigenesis of&#xA0;gastric cancer, esophageal squamous carcinoma, and osteosarcoma (). In summary, all these prognostic s in the gene signature are strongly associated with cancers mainly by regulating autophagy and apoptosis. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that these s can be used as prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for  To better understand the biological role and signaling pathways of the 13 s in the signature, we performed , G, ssA analysis, and  network.  and G analysis uncovered that these prognostic genes were significantly associated with response to oxidative stress and apoptosis signaling pathway. Consistently, ssA analysis indicated that cell cycle,  repair, and  replication pathways were significantly enriched in high-risk group, all of which were well-known cancer-related pathways. Moreover, our results validated the correlation between the risk score and these pathways.  network showed the interaction network of the 13 s and additional 20 genes closely linked to the signature. Top three genes with highest connectivity degree in the  network were 2L1 (degree = 23),  (degree = 22), and P8 (degree = 20). Caspase8 (encoded by P8), the activation of which can be suppressed by P (encoded by ), plays a crucial part in the execution-phase of death receptor&#x2010;mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway and &#x3B1;&#x2010;induced apoptotic and necroptotic cell death (). In summary, we speculate that the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis plays a vital role in the prognosis of C patients and our results provide some insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumor progression in  With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics, a large number of gene signatures based on various kinds of  expression data have been constructed to predict prognosis in C (). Nevertheless, compared with our study, these studies lacked independent validation in external datasets. Furthermore, most of these studies only concentrated on molecular biomarkers and ignored the value of traditional clinical parameters. We integrated clinical parameters with the autophagy-related signature for predicting survival in C for the first time, which showed great promise for clinical application. However, there are still some limitations in our study. First, our study is retrospective thus the gene signature and nomogram need to be further verified in prospective studies and multi-center clinical trials. Second, the information from A and  databases is limited and incomplete. Several potential risk factors such as radiotherapy and pathological features were not enrolled in our nomogram. Third, more investigations are needed to further reveal the function and mechanisms of these prognostic s in  In conclusion, our study identified a 13-s prognostic signature based on a thorough analysis of s expression profile in  Then we constructed a promising prognostic nomogram by integrating both the gene signature and multiple clinical parameters. Our gene signature and nomogram may provide an accurate and reliable prediction approach for the prognosis of C patients and thus help clinicians optimize and personalize treatment strategies. The genes identified in the prognostic signature also provide some insight for novel prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, large-scale and prospective clinical investigations should be carried out to validate the clinical utility of our signature and associated underlying biological mechanisms remain to be further unveiled.

It can reduce the amount of tobacco grown by 50&#x2013;70%. In this research of study, we aimed to identify tobacco mosaic virus proteins and healthy tobacco leaf proteins by using machine learning approaches. The experiment's results showed that the support vector machine algorithm achieved high accuracy in different feature extraction methods. And 188-dimensions feature extraction method improved the classification accuracy. In that the support vector machine algorithm and 188-dimensions feature extraction method were finally selected as the final experimental methods. In the 10-fold cross-validation processes, the  combined with 188-dimensions achieved 93.5% accuracy on the training set and 92.7% accuracy on the independent validation set. Besides, the evaluation index of the results of experiments indicate that the method developed by us is valid and robust. Tobacco mosaic virus is worldwide distribution and is the furthest invasive virus which is most harmful to crops. Tobacco is one of the important economic crops in our country, however, the existence of tobacco mosaic disease has greatly reduced the yield and quality of tobacco. Since plants do not have a complete immune system, once infected, the leaves can show mosaic symptoms or even deformities and the growth can also be chronically diseased, which makes tobacco mosaic virus is very difficult to control (Hu and Lee, ). The study of viruses has attracted many scholars, and with the development of computer machine learning algorithms, many scholars have applied machine learning algorithms to the study of viruses. Metzler and Kalinina () developed a -based predictor that exhibited good performance and avoided the expensive costs required for experiments. Using biochemical experiments to study all tobacco mosaic virus is a challenge because it is expensive and a waste of researchers' time, and there is no specific predictor to predict tobacco mosaic virus. So, in this research we evaluated the predictive performance of different classifiers in combination with different feature extraction methods. We have chosen classical machine learning algorithms and classical feature extraction methods. The feature extraction methods  (Chou, ) and their combination were chosen for the reasons.  is the first proposed feature extraction method that is widely used to predict the function of proteins. It based on their amino acid composition. P describes the spatial distribution information of amino acids, 188 dimensions in addition to the physicochemical properties of amino acids. Three feature extraction methods from different aspects, so these three feature extraction methods were chosen. The combined feature extraction method was attempted considering the expectation of better results. We finally chose the combination of support vector machine () with 188-dimensions as the final predictor because it has the best prediction effect. Our method was developed based on three steps (). Step 1: we collected the data and preprocessed the dataset to obtain a non-redundant benchmark dataset that does not contain non-standard characters. Step 2: We used Amino Acid Composition (), feature extraction method based on the composition of amino acid sequence and physicochemical properties (188-dimensions), composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (P), and the combined methods _P and 188_P which are proposed in this paper to extract features from protein sequences. Step 3: Five algorithms and 10-fold cross-validation are used to build and estimate the models, which are Random Forest (), Bagging, K-Nearest Neighbor (), Naive Bayes (), and Support Vector Machine (). Then, we validated experimental results using an independent validation set. Schematic showing the workflow used to develop our method. , P, 188-dimensions, _P, 188_ P are our five feature extraction methods. Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Algorithm, , Random Forest and Bagging are our five classification algorithms. High-quality baseline data sets contribute to the accuracy of model predictions (Yang et al., ). After removing the redundant sequences, we eventually obtained a dataset of 715 protein sequences of  proteins and 17,983 protein sequences of tobacco leaf proteins. There are 715 sequences in the positive datasets and 17,893 sequences in the negative datasets. Much more negative data than positive data. For the purpose of balancing the datasets, we took a downsampling approach. We split the negative data by the size of the positive data. And randomly selected 10 of these copies as the negative dataset, so we obtained a negative dataset containing 7,150 sequences. The resulting positive and negative datasets were divided proportionally. The final training dataset consists of 500 positive data and 5,000 negative data. The test dataset consists of 215 positive data and 2,150 negative data. These data are available in our software package. Feature selection will affect the performance of machine learning methods for bioinformatics problems (Zhao et al., ). In the research of this paper, five feature extraction methods are selected, including amino acid composition (), composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (P), 188-dimensions feature extraction method, and the combined methods _P and 188_P which are proposed in this paper. The coded amino acid composition coding scheme (Bhasin and Raghava, ). The calculation formula for each amino acid is as follows: Where ). The composition of K-spaced amino acid pairs (Chen et al., ). Taking K = 0 as an e.g., a feature vector is defined as: wherein, (1 appears in the sequence and Cn represents the total number of residue pairs with a gap of 0 in the sequence. In a protein sequence of length N, for different values of K, the value of n can be defined as: When K takes each value, the P feature vector (&#x3B3;) has a total size of 150 dimensions. Each amino acid sequence has different physical and chemical properties including amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, normalized Van der Waals volume, polarity, polarizability, charge, surface tension, secondary structure, and solvent accessibility for each residue in the sequence (Cai et al., ). The feature extraction method for protein P is formulated as follows: Where C represents the frequency of a kind of specific attribute (such as polarity) amino acid appearing in the global sequence. Tr represents the global percentage of transitions between a specific amino acid and another amino acid of a specific property. D is used to describe the first, 25%, 50%, 75% and last position of each specific amino acid in the peptide chain. Assume that the protein sequence &#x201C;&#x201D; has 17 valines ( = (3.13, 15.63, 40.63, 65.23, 96.88). In the same way, the position of asparagine in the peptide chain can be found. In summary, the amino acid composition descriptors are C = (53.13, 64.87), Tr = (53.13), and D = (3.13, 15.63, 40.63, 65.23, 96.88, 6.25, 28.13, 68.75, 78.13, 100.00). Descriptors of other attributes can be described through a similar process, and then all the descriptors are combined to form a 188-dimensions feature vector. A combination of , P, and feature extraction based on a combination of sequence and physicochemical properties constitute a new feature extraction method. The number of characterization dimensions for the _P combination is 170, and the number of characterization dimensions for the 188_P combination is 338. Since the information of amino acid content is included in the 188-dimensions feature extraction method, the combination of  and 188-dimensions feature extraction method is not used in this paper. In this paper, five classifiers were used for the experiments. these classifiers were implemented through Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software (Azuaje et al., ). Random Forest () is an integrated learning method first proposed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler (Azuaje et al., ). For processing large amounts of data, Random Forest is characterized by high accuracy, high speed and good robustness. In , we need to input the prediction samples into each tree for prediction, and finally use the voting algorithm to determine the result of prediction. The voting algorithm is shown speed and good robustness. The anti-noise capability of  is strong, and it often shows good robustness when processing high-dimensional data. The voting algorithm is shown below: Where result is the final prediction,  represents the predicted result for each decision tree, which equals to 1 or &#x2212;1, and n represents the number of Decision Trees in the model. Support Vector Machine () is often applied to classification problems and is a supervised learning approach (Huang et al., ). The K-Nearest Neighbor () algorithm (Zhang and Zhou, ) which is one of the simplest, most convenient, and highly effective algorithms. Now it has been frequently used in the functional classification of proteins problems. The key step of  prediction is to find the K neighbors closest to the test data from the training set, and then use the category with the most K neighbors as the final category of the test data. In this experiment, we adopt the  algorithm based on the Harmanton distance and the Harmanton distance formula is summarized as follows: where: (k=1, 2, 3, &#x2026;&#x2026;n) is characteristic of the test dataset. The Naive Bayes () is a easily understand classification algorithm (Xue et al., ), which is based on the Bayesian classifier and assumes that the feature attributes of the data are simple and independent. In the classification scenario, it greatly reduces the complexity of the Bayesian classification algorithm. Suppose the sample data set is: there are m samples and each sample have n features. The data set has a total of class variable. Generally speaking, the m samples can be classified into s categories, where n features are independent of each other. The category of S is defined as follows: Among them, there are M class variables in the set  Naive Bayes formula is defined as follows: Bagging is a typical integrated learning algorithm (Abell&#xE1;n et al., )}, a weak learner algorithm is used to classify each time, and a total of T iterations are made, and finally we will obtain a powerful classifier. Since it samples each training model, it has a strong generalization ability that can significantly reduce the variance of the training model. There are five main parameters (Kou and Feng, ). Defined as follows: Where  represents the amount of tobacco mosaic virus correctly predicted by the model (Dong et al.,  is the score of the i-th positive sample was calculated by classification. The higher the value of the five evaluation indicators above, the better the model prediction. The  and  of  and  were mostly higher than the predictors of ,  and Bagging under different feature extraction methods ().  obtained by five feature extraction methods [ , 188-dimensions, P, _P, and 188-P] combined with five classifiers (, , , , Bagging) through 10-fold cross-validation. Different feature extraction methods were used to predict the performance of different classification methods. The average  value of the classifier was tested by 10-fold cross-validation. However, when comparing predictor superiority, it is possible to use not only the predicted  and  comparison, but also the trade-off between Sn and Sp. The sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of , , and Bagging predictor variables are greater than those of  and  (). This result shows that , , and Bagging predict tobacco mosaic virus are better than  and  due to the difference in the ability of these five common classification algorithms to handle multidimensional datasets.  is a naive algorithm based on the assumption that the individual properties are independent of each other, and  is very friendly to low dimensional features. However, for multidimensional datasets, there is often some correlation between attribute features. The low  of  may be because the small size of the training datasets. The ,  and Bagging classification algorithms do not require much in terms of dataset dimensionality, and they can handle high-dimensional, noisy and missing datasets with strong correlation between attributes. Predictive effect of , , , , and Bagging on different trait extraction methods for tobacco mosaic virus. . In addition, we also used the test datasets to verify the model. The results are shown in . The results show that the model constructed by  combined with 188-dimensions or 188_P achieves a high , which shows that this model is reliable. Although the model constructed by  combined with 188-dimensions or 188_P is lower than other algorithms in terms of , evaluation indicators such as Sp, Sn, and  have all achieved the best results. Therefore, the  algorithm is very promising in  classification. Due to the above reasons, this experiment chose  as the final classifier to predict . Through the use of test data, the evaluation results of the prediction model of , , , , and Bagging combined with different types of extraction methods. . Among different feature extraction, Bagging predictor combined with 188-dimensions feature extraction to obtain the best prediction performance. ,  and  predictors combined with  feature extraction to obtain the best prediction performance. The prediction models built by  combined with 188-dimensions or 188_P feature extraction have obtained the best prediction results (). The  value obtained by the predictor constructed by  combined with five feature selection methods (, 188-dimensions, P, _P, and 188-P). In addition, the classification effect of the classifier constructed by 188-dimensions combined with different classification algorithms in terms of Sn, Sp, ,  is higher than other feature extraction methods, which proves that the prediction model of the former is better than other models (). In the test datasets,  combined with 188-dimensions obtained a prediction accuracy of 92.77%, which proves that the prediction model is reliable. Therefore, in this study, we use 188-dimensions as the final feature extraction method. Sn, Sp, and  values obtained by 10-fold cross-validation through five feature extraction methods [ , 188-dimensions, P, _P, and 188-P] combined with five classifiers (, , , , Bagging). Rapid and accurate identification of tobacco mosaic virus is the key to successfully protecting tobacco from poison. Kumar and Prakash () used direct antigen coating enzyme linked immunoassay (-) technique to detect the  virus from pepper samples. However, this method is very complicated in sample preparation and detection processes, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our goal was to distinguish between tobacco mosaic virus proteins and healthy tobacco leaf proteins in a large amount of data. The work in this paper provides an effective method to solve this problem. In this experiment, first, we constructed a high-quality benchmark tobacco mosaic virus protein data set, which ensures the reliability of the classification tool. Secondly, we compared the performance of five feature extraction and five classifier constructs as predictors through 10-fold cross-validation, and then validated each model with the test datasets. The results show that  combined with 188-dimensions feature extraction method has the best prediction performance. It has obtained 93.58% accuracy on the train datasets and 92.77% accuracy on the test datasets, which proves that the prediction model has good robustness, so this paper chooses support vector machine as the prediction engine. We hope that these findings will help the development of identification of tobacco mosaic virus.

This study aimed to test the safety and feasibility of this concept in a phase I setting. Fifteen adult patients with the first recurrence of  were treated with personalized -surgery, ields, and physician&#x2019;s choice oncological therapy. The primary endpoint was toxicity and secondary endpoints included standard efficacy outcomes. -surgery resulted in a mean skull defect area of 10.6 cm producing a median ields enhancement of 32% (range 25&#x2013;59%). The median ields treatment duration was 6.8 months and the median compliance rate 90%. Patients received either bevacizumab, bevacizumab/irinotecan, or temozolomide rechallenge. We observed 71 adverse events (s) of grades 1 (52%), 2 (35%), and 3 (13%). There were no grade 4 or 5 s or intervention-related serious s. Six patients experienced minor ields-induced skin rash. The median progression-free survival () was 4.6 months and the  rate at 6 months was 36%. The median overall survival () was 15.5 months and the  rate at 12 months was 55%. ields therapy combined with -surgery and medical oncological treatment is safe and nontoxic and holds the potential to improve the outcome for  patients through focal dose enhancement in the tumor. Craniectomy and small burr holes in the skull focally enhance the dose of ields. Craniectomy is safe in combination with ields and not a contraindication. ields in combination with craniectomy or small burr holes is safe and likely effective. We present phase I data for a new, rational, and innovative intervention combining tumor treating fields (ields) with targeted skull remodeling surgery to enhance the field dose and clinical efficacy against recurrent glioblastoma. The concept builds on preclinical dosimetry studies and recent clinical evidence that the field dose correlates with overall survival. Our study is the first to successfully achieve a significant and personalized ields dose accumulation focally in the tumor and we have used dosimetry methods to illustrate the concept and its impact. The treatment is easy to understand and implement and potentially extends to all intracranial applications of ields. Our data suggest that the treatment is safe and effective (median overall survival 15.5 months and progression-free survival rate at 6 months is 36%). Based on these results, we have initiated a subsequent prospective randomized phase 2 clinical trial scheduled to begin recruitment in summer 2020 (04223999). Glioblastoma () is the most prevalent and severe primary adult brain cancer. Despite maximum safe resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis is dismal with a median overall survival () of approximately 1 year for newly diagnosed cases. Different methods have been implemented to quantify the dose distribution of ields in the brain and provide strategies for treatment planning and response prediction. Although the efficacy of ields is influenced by multiple factors, such as frequency and spatial correlation of the fields, for further details on ields dosimetry and its clinical implications. Using dosimetry methods, we previously showed that skull remodeling surgery (-surgery), including burr holes and minor craniectomies placed above the tumor region, provide a substantial (~70%) and highly focused enhancement of ields in the tumor without affecting the dose in the healthy tissues (). Distributions of current density and field intensity before and after -surgery. Panel A shows the position of one array pair on the surface of the patients head, while the craniectomy and underlying regions of interest (tumor, yellow; peritumoral border zone, blue) are shown in panel  Craniectomy reduced the amount of current shunted through the skin between the arrays (panel C vs E) and redirects the current through the hole in the skull (panel D vs F) and toward the tumor. Panel G shows the change in field intensity induced on the surface of the brain. Craniectomy enhances the field intensity by approximately 300 V/m in the region of interest, while the dose in the surrounding brain tissue remains unaffected. Here, we present the results of a proof-of-concept phase I clinical trial testing -surgery as a rational, innovative, and dose-enhancing method to improve ields therapy against r. The trial was a prospective, open-label, single-center phase I trial investigating safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of -surgery in combination with ields and best choice chemotherapy for r (clinicaltrials.gov id 02893137). The study was performed at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, in the period October 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019. All study procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association for further protocol details. Inclusion criteria were (1) age &#x2265;18 years, (2) histopathological primary diagnosis of  using the  2016 classification, based on  performed no later than 4 weeks prior to enrollment, (7) Karnofsky performance score () &#x2265;70, (8) ability to comply with ields, (9) significant expected benefit from feasible -surgery combined with ields, that is, (a) focal disease and (b) at least some part of the tumor or resection cavity had to be closer than 2 cm from the brain surface, and (10) signed written consent form. Exclusion criteria were (1) pregnancy or nursing, (2) less than 4 weeks since radiation therapy, (3) infratentorial tumor, (4) implanted pacemaker, (5) programmable shunts, (6) deep brain stimulator, (7) refractory symptomatic epilepsy, (8) contraindications for -surgery, for example, bleeding diathesis or severe infection, (9) significant comorbidities, that is, significant liver function impairment, significant renal impairment, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and (10) active participation in another therapeutic interventional clinical trial. Patients were also excluded if r could not be confirmed on histopathological examination of resected tissue after inclusion. All patients were treated with -surgery, ields, and physician&#x2019;s choice medical oncological therapy. The objective of the -surgery was to maximize the field intensity (ie, dose) in the residual tumor or the region surrounding the resection cavity. The -surgery configuration was optimized for each individual (see  as a safety limitation for mechanical brain protection. This area limit was exceeded at the request of 2 patients, as a larger defect induced greater field enhancement in these cases. The -surgery design was conducted prior to surgery and implemented with neuronavigation. Examples of -surgery. Panel A shows 3 examples of -surgery configurations illustrated with 3D reconstructions of the skull surface based on  scans. Four burr holes of 15 mm diameter were used in the leftmost example, 7 burr holes of 18 mm diameter in the middle example, and a total elliptic craniectomy of 85 &#xD7; 65 mm semi-axes in the rightmost example, respectively. In all cases, the skull defects were distributed above the resection cavity and its surrounding borders, as shown in panel B for the leftmost case in panel  The representation in panel B generally shows the skull and tumor outline in the computational model for the (courtesy of Novocure, Ltd) with the skull surface shown in . Maximum safe resection was performed for all patients, although this was not an inclusion criterion. Surgeries resulting in measurable residual disease on the postoperative  (&lt;72 h) according to the O criteria were classified as partial resections, whereas surgeries resulting in no residual disease or nonmeasurable residual disease were categorized as gross total resections. ields therapy was initiated 4 weeks from surgery. Array layouts were planned to maximize the ields dose in the tumor. The virtual placement of electrodes was performed using the SimS  and a custom Matlab script (Mathworks, Inc.). Medical oncological treatment was initiated 2&#x2013;4 weeks after surgery and included bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 3 administrations per cycle) alone or in combination with either lomustine (90 mg/m The primary endpoint was the severity and frequency of s evaluated by the investigators using v4.0. Secondary endpoints were median ,  at 6 months (6), median ,  rate at 12 months (12), objective response rate, quality of life (QoL) score ( -C30 and &#x2013;20 questionnaires), Clinical examination, including QoL and toxicity assessment, was conducted (1) at baseline, (2) postoperatively during admission, (3) before ields and medical oncological therapy, and (4) regularly during adjuvant treatment. , clinical examination, and laboratory tests were conducted every 12 weeks during follow-up, while QoL and toxicity were assessed every 6 weeks. Additional examinations were conducted upon suspected or validated progression. ields therapy was discontinued upon (1) disease recurrence, that is, second overall disease recurrence, (2) grade 3&#x2013;5 serious  () caused by the intervention, or (3) unacceptable s regardless of grade. Upon active request from the patient, ields therapy beyond progression was allowed on a compassionate use basis or in connection with continued medical treatment. Patients were excluded in the events of (1) death, (2) trial completion, (3) loss to follow-up, (4) withdrawal of consent, or (5) safety prohibiting further participation. The trial was terminated when the final patient was excluded and the necessary data had been acquired. Furthermore, the trial was set to stop in the occurrence of more than 8 s attributed to the intervention. The trial was exploratory and descriptive so we did not perform sample size calculations nor risk stratification (. Twenty patients were screened for participation in the period December 12, 2016 to April 25, 2018. Fifteen were enrolled and followed up until May 31, 2019 (. The median follow-up period was 14.8 months (range 5.8&#x2013;25.2 months). All patients were followed up until exclusion and none were lost to follow-up. Patient flow diagram. Patient Characteristics and Treatment Outline ields was discontinued for 8 out of the 11 patients. All cases of permanent ields discontinuation occurred due to disease progression. s did not result in discontinuation for any patient. Four patients continued ields therapy beyond progression. Two of these were on a compassionate use basis, while the other 2 also continued active medical treatment with temozolomide and bevacizumab, respectively. Three patients were still on active ields at the end of the trial period. We included 11 male patients and 4 female patients. All patients had - along with the general treatment outline. For the 15 enrolled participants, the median time from inclusion to -surgery and resection was 6 days (range 0&#x2013;14 days).  for the extent of resection). Of the 11 patients receiving ields, 3 had 4 burr holes of 15 mm diameter, 1 had 5 holes of 15 mm diameter, 4 had 6 holes of 15 mm diameter, 1 had 5 peripheral 15 mm holes and 1 central 25 mm hole, 1 had 7 holes of 15 mm diameter, and 1 had an elliptic craniectomy (semi-axis diameters 85 &#xD7; 65 mm). Of the 4 patients excluded before ields therapy, 2 had five 15 mm holes, 1 had eight 20 mm holes, and 1 had a total craniectomy (60 &#xD7; 50 mm). Two of these patients had gross total resection and 2 had nonmeasurable residual tumors. The relationship between the -surgery configuration, for example, the size, arrangement, and number of burr holes, and the induced relative field enhancement was highly complex (), that is, also the 4 patients who did not proceed to ields therapy. Since all 15 included patients contribute information about the expected field enhancement and the potential correlation with  size and configuration, we included all patients in the correlation analysis. Details of the ields treatment and adjuvant therapy are given in . Of all patients receiving ields, 8 were treated with bevacizumab monotherapy (median number of cycles = 5, range 2&#x2013;16). One patient received bevacizumab/irinotecan combination treatment (2 cycles), while 2 patients were treated with temozolomide rechallenge (3 and 4 cycles, respectively). Of the 4 patients not treated with ields, 1 received supportive care only, 2 bevacizumab monotherapy (6 and 9 cycles, respectively), and 1 bevacizumab/lomustine combination treatment (7 cycles). Of those experiencing progression during ields (ie, second total recurrence), 2 patients were reoperated, 5 discontinued all treatment, 1 continued bevacizumab with the addition of irinotecan (3 cycles), 1 received temozolomide rechallenge (6 cycles), 1 continued bevacizumab in combination with lomustine (2 cycles), and 1 continued bevacizumab monotherapy (8 cycles). Of the 4 patients not receiving ields, 3 discontinued all treatment at progression in the trial (ie, second recurrence) and 1 received 2 cycles of temozolomide before discontinuation. The observed s are presented in  (causality). Frequency of Adverse Events The table shows the numbers and frequencies of patients experiencing the observed s. A patient is registered as having an , if the  occurred at least once, regardless of severity. All observed s were of grades 1&#x2013;3. Patients are separated into those treated with ields (left column) and those not treated with ields (middle column). The right column shows results for all patients collectively.  list a breakdown of the  data into grades and causalities, respectively. In total, we observed 71 s of which most were mild to moderate (grade 1 or 2). Considering all patients, 52%, 95% : 40&#x2013;64%, of all s were strictly mild with a maximum grade of 1, while 35%, 95% : 24&#x2013;48%, were moderate or below with a maximum grade of 2. We recorded 11 grade 3 s (13%, 95% : 7&#x2013;23%), all unrelated to the intervention, and no grade 4 or 5 s. Most s were neurological ( = 5): Three were seizures, which required admission and occurred at progression in patients with prior seizures, 1 experienced a severe headache, while 2 had progressive focal deficits in connection with disease progression. Systemic s were fatigue, deep vein thrombosis, and diarrhea all unrelated to the intervention. Patients excluded prior to ields therapy, that is, within 4 weeks from inclusion, accounted for 19.0%, 95% : 11&#x2013;30%, of s. These were mainly neurological deficits attributed to the disease itself or resection surgery, although one patient did experience a grade 3 postoperative infection, which led to exclusion and required surgical revision. None of the surgical s could be directly attributed to the -surgery per se but rather to the general concept of open surgery, for example, infection, or to tumor resection, for example, postoperative deficits. Neurological s accounted for 37%, 95% : 26&#x2013;49%, of all s regardless of grade. The most common neurological s were headache ( = 7). Headache was the most frequently observed  overall, occurring in 60%, 95% : 32&#x2013;84%, of all patients and exclusively in those treated with ields. A causal relationship between headache and ields was found in 3 cases, while 1 was related to surgery and 5 had unknown causes although unrelated to the intervention. Focal neurological deficits were caused by the disease or resection surgery and all seizures were attributed to disease and progression. Systemic s accounted for 39%, 95% : 28&#x2013;52%, and were generally associated with chemotherapy, , or unknown causes. The most common systemic s were fatigue (40% of patients, 95% : 16&#x2013;68%), nausea (40% of patients, 95% : 16&#x2013;68%), and fever (33% of patients, 95% : 12&#x2013;62%). Causality could not be firmly established in 15 of the 29 observed systemic s, although these were likely attributed to medical oncological treatment or  (eg, fever, nausea, and fatigue). No systemic  was related to ields, 6 were caused by medical oncological treatment (nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), 4 were caused by surgery (postoperative fatigue, nausea, and fever), while 3 s had other causes, such as opiate administration or corticosteroid withdrawal. Regional s accounted for 24%, 95% : 15&#x2013;36%, of all cases and mainly comprised grade 1 and 2 skin rash (55% of ields-treated patients, 95% : 23&#x2013;83%) and minor scalp ulcerations (18%, 95% : 2.3&#x2013;52%). These manifestations only occurred in patients treated with ields and were observed with caution and easily managed with topical corticosteroids and short pauses (1&#x2013;3 days) in ields. One patient had a poor compliance rate of 48% on average due to recurring scalp ulcers. The patient had previously been treated repeatedly with antibiotics for pustulous acne and hidrosadenitis. The ulcers occurred with unchanged frequency and severity and also at distant locations unaffected by ields, for example, in the axillary and perineal regions. One patient had a minor postoperative wound rupture with localized infection, which was successfully treated with minor wound revision in local anesthesia and oral antibiotics. This resulted in a 2-week delay of ields initiation but did not affect the remaining treatment. One patient in the ields group had a minor wound rupture shortly after surgery, which was successfully treated with a single suture. There were no signs of infection and the complications did not affect the medical oncological treatment or ield. No surgery inflicted s could be associated with the skull remodeling procedure per se, but rather represented common neurosurgical complications, for example, due to resection or complicated wound healing. Within the investigated range of -surgery, encompassing minor burr holes and large craniectomies, we did not observe particular toxicity limitations or reach an apparent maximum-tolerated dose neither for the induced field intensity nor for the introduced skull defects. Survival estimates and efficacy outcomes are presented in . Efficacy Outcome Estimates The median daily methylprednisolone dose was 14.3 mg (range 0&#x2013;50 mg) over the course of the trial. The mean total decline in steroid dose during the trial, that is, the presurgical dose at inclusion minus the dose at the time of progression, was considerable (11.8&#xB1; 19.4 mg) with the most significant reduction occurring after surgery. Accordingly, the presurgical dose at inclusion was reduced by 10.4&#xB1; 14.3 mg at the time of initiation of ields and oncological treatment and further by 1.45 &#xB1; 12.0 mg at the time of disease progression ( Two of these patients experienced progression before 6 months, and 2 died before 1 year of follow-up. The sample size was too low to analyze this correlation. Eight of the 11 patients treated with ields had stable  from inclusion until progression (73%, 95% : 39&#x2013;94%). Three experienced a  decline of 10&#x2013;20 points after resection surgery (27%, 95% : 6.0&#x2013;61%). In 2 of these patients,  remained stable from surgery until progression (18%, 95% : 2.3&#x2013;52%), while the final patient experienced a  recovery of 10 points during ields therapy (9.1%, 95% : 0.2&#x2013;41%). QoL scores were comparable to previous observations,. The majority of the patients had high and constant global (median = 141&#x2013;167) and functional (median = 80&#x2013;89) QoL scores throughout the trial. Symptom scores were generally low (median = 8.5&#x2013;11). In this study, we have evaluated the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of ields in combination with targeted -surgery against recurrent . The intervention introduces skull holes in the vicinity of the tumor to facilitate the current flow into the region of interest and thereby enhance the ields efficacy. The intervention was well tolerated and we observed no s directly attributed to the intervention. s were all grade 3 and included fever, fatigue, diarrhea, deep vein thrombosis, as well as seizures occurring at progression in patients with previously known tumor-induced epilepsy. Overall, the most prevalent  was headache (60% of patients), whereas minor skin rash of grades 1 and 2 was the most common  in patients treated with ields (55%). These observations correspond well with previously reported rates) and caused by the disease or the medical oncological treatment. With regard to efficacy, we observed positive preliminary signals justifying further investigations. The median  was 15.5 months, 95%  = 9.4%&#x2013;, which is a considerable improvement compared to the 9 months commonly reported for patients receiving comparable second-line oncological treatment alone.). Despite promising outcomes, our study was subject to important caveats to be considered. Given the small sample size, it was not powered for conclusive estimation, confounder adjustment, or direct comparison with historical data. Furthermore, our cohort was subject to selection bias in the sense that (1) the male/female = 9/2 ratio was higher than expected, (2) the clinical performance was relatively high (median  = 90, range 70&#x2013;100), (3) the rate of gross total resection among ields treated patients was high (9/11), and (4) the median ields compliance rate was high (90%, range 48&#x2013;98), of which the latter 3 are known favorable outcome predictors. Also, it should be noted that array placement was based on edge effect considerations and general rules of thumb and not the standard practice Novo approach. Although this approach may have impacted the ields efficacy on its own, previous studies indicate that such effects would likely be considerably less compared to those induced by the -surgery. We consider the tested intervention suitable for further investigation, and a randomized controlled phase 2 trial (04223999) is scheduled to begin recruitment in the fall of 2020. The trial includes ields in both treatment arms and patients are randomized 1:1 to receive -surgery or not. The trial was designed to test the potential for clinical implementation of -surgery with ields and further to shed additional light on the ields dose&#x2013;response relationship. Finally, there is a need for further characterization of the effects of different  configurations, including the number, size, and arrangement of burr holes.

Although vaccination programmes are one of the major preventive measures to control communicable diseases, decline of trust in vaccines is spreading and coverage of childhood immunization has decreased in several high-income countries [].  In Europe, in order to contrast the spread of vaccines&#x2019; rejection and/or delay, countries such as Italy and France enacted laws that make several vaccinations at the paediatric age mandatory, and other countries are also considering introducing immunization mandates. Childhood mandatory vaccination is a useful strategy when a country faces declining vaccination rates; however, it should be accompanied by strategies to spread the &#x201C;culture of vaccination&#x201D; within communities, in order to be make vaccination programmes understandable, acceptable and therefore sustainable []. Parents&#x2019; attitude towards vaccination is affected by several elements linked to confidence, convenience, and complacency []. Communicating effectively about vaccines does not simply mean providing technical information or counteracting false information according to ineffective persuasive models []. Prenatal courses and birth points can be considered &#x201C;early settings&#x201D; in which the communication regarding vaccines is carried out through interactive methods during pregnancy or within the days of delivery, i.e., at least two&#x2013;three months before the first session of vaccination.  In countries such as Italy, almost all births take place in hospitals and prenatal courses are offered free of charge by local health services. However, the communication regarding vaccines is not an integral part of the institutional mission of these services, and the implementation of vaccination meetings during the antenatal course or at the point of birth depends on the resourcefulness of the single health workers of these services, and is not widespread in the national territory []. The hypothesis of an association between vaccine attitude and exposure to interactive meetings in an early setting, if supported by several studies, could trigger further studies with experimental designs, leading to institutionalising meetings on vaccines in prenatal courses and at birth centres.  The present paper aims to contribute to the assessment of this hypothesis by presenting the results of an explorative &#x201C;natural history&#x201D; study that analyses the attitudes of a sample of Italian mothers of new-borns towards vaccines and its potential association with interactive meetings on this topic carried out during prenatal courses and at birth points. This study was performed in Cagliari, Sardinia (Italy) between 2015 and 2016. During these years, the law no.119/2017 on compulsory vaccination had not come into force yet; the National Health System () provided free-of-charge childhood vaccination, which includes four compulsory vaccines (poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B), and eight recommended ones (pertussis, haemophilus, measles, rubella, mumps, chicken pox, meningococcal group c, pneumococcal disease). This exploratory study was carried out during a broader cross-sectional study mainly aimed at analysing informative needs and attitudes towards breastfeeding. In order to collect data, a questionnaire in the Italian language was administered through structured interviews by trained health professionals. Data were collected anonymously.  Participants were recruited among mothers of new-borns waiting for congenital hip dysplasia ultrasound screening to be taken in one of the regional dedicated centres in Cagliari; the regional health system offers this screening to all new-borns. A hip ultrasound is performed in the first period of the child&#x2019;s life, on average at 1&#x2013;2 months. During the recruitment phase, the researchers explained the following aspects: participation in the survey was voluntary, no identifying data would be collected, the interview would focus on knowledge and attitudes towards breastfeeding and vaccination, the results of the survey will be published only in aggregate form. In accordance with the research topic and method, we considered verbal consent appropriate. Asking for verbal consent and administering the questionnaire by interview was the ideal way to encourage participation, because it allowed the interviewees to participate in the survey and at the same time to care for their new-born babies (e.g., cradle them, breastfeed them). Less than 5% of mothers refused to undertake the interview ( = 12). In order to minimise risks of recall bias, only mothers of children younger than 4 months of age were involved in the study. In total, 266 mothers were interviewed, and 95% of new-borns were less than three months old.  The first part of the questionnaire was aimed at collecting social and demographic data, as well as some variables concerning attendance of prenatal courses, whether they were primigravidae and how old their babies were in that moment. In order to assess exposure to information on vaccines during pregnancy and childbirth, and attitude towards vaccines, the following questions were asked: In the open ended questions, the interviewers reported the exact words used by the interviewees. The interview process and data extraction process are shown in . As for the different exposures to communication regarding vaccination, mothers were classified into three groups: As for the attitudes to vaccinations, mothers were asked whether their children would undertake all the free-of-charge vaccinations offered by the National Health System (). Attitudes to vaccinations were classified according to the following definitions: Collected data were analysed by means of descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals. A chi-squared test for linear trend was used to analyse the association between the attitude to vaccination and the different exposures to communication regarding vaccines. Additionally, this association was analysed through a multivariable logistic regression model in order to assess potential confounding effects of the main social and demographic variables. In the logistic model, vaccination attitude was included as the dependent variable (vaccine hesitancy attitude vs pro-vaccine attitude). Age of mothers (continuous variable), education (having a diploma or more vs lower education level), being primigravidae (yes vs no), working in the health sector (yes vs no), premature delivery (yes vs no) and exposure to information on vaccines (non-exposed mothers vs mothers exposed to conventional and early communicative settings; mothers exposed to conventional communicative setting vs mothers exposed to conventional and early communicative settings) were included as independent variables. Starting from the saturated model including all independent variables, non-significant associated variables ( value &#x2265; 0.05) were consecutively deleted from the model through a step by step procedure managed by researchers. The goodness of fit of the models obtained in each step was assessed through the likelihood statistics. The final regression model included only significant associated variables. The estimated sample size necessary to assess factors associated with vaccination attitude was 250. In order to explore the reasons for the attitude towards vaccine hesitancy, the answers to the open-ended question on this topic were analysed, merging similar contents into the same category. The results were illustrated through a mental map, with a textual explanatory quotation for each identified category. The study involved 266 mothers of new-born babies who gave birth to their child less than 4 months ago. Sample description is reported in . At the moment of the study, 67% of the babies were 1 or 2 months old. The mean age for the mothers was 33 years, about 3/4 of them declared to live in the metropolitan area of Cagliari, 81% completed high school, 4% work in the health field, 62% were primigravidae and 39% attended a prenatal course. Lack of time, already having other children and lack of interest were the reasons for not attending the prenatal course. Overall, 26% ( = 70) of the interviewed women participated in interactive meetings on vaccines during attendance of the prenatal classes or at the birth point. As far as attitude towards vaccination is concerned, 80% of mothers ( 76&#x2013;84%) said, without any uncertainty, that they were willing to follow the whole vaccine schedule provided by the , and to respect the recommended deadlines; the remaining 20% ( 16&#x2013;24%) showed an orientation towards vaccine hesitancy. More specifically, 48 out of 53 mothers stated that they would like to submit their children only to some of the free vaccinations offered by the , while the remaining five mothers said they would postpone joining the vaccination program. Mothers showing vaccine hesitancy were asked, by means of an open-ended question, which vaccines they more hesitant about: 53% generically referred to all the vaccines without of any specific mention, 30% expressed hesitancy about the recommended vaccines without any specific mention, while only 17% mentioned specific vaccines. More specifically, 13% of hesitant mothers cited vaccination against measles&#x2013;mumps&#x2013;rubella, 2% meningococcal vaccination and 2% tetanus. As for the reasons for the attitude to vaccine hesitancy, almost all the &#x201C;vaccine-hesitant&#x201D; mothers declared to be worried about possible negative consequences linked to vaccines (). The stated reasons for concern were contraindications and side effects, the low age for vaccination, vaccine ingredients, the number of suggested vaccines per session (considered as the cause for an excess in immune stimulation), and risk for autism. Additionally, negatively perceived vaccine experiences contributed to determining concern, not only if they have been experienced in a direct way, but also when they are simply reported. Concern about the potential consequences of vaccines was sometimes coupled with the perceived futility of some vaccines; this perception emerged both in relation to the perceived non-hazardousness (measles) or low frequency (tetanus) of some diseases, and in relation to the inability of some vaccines to provide protection against all possible serotypes capable of transmitting a specific disease (meningitis). The perception of not having acquired the necessary knowledge to be able to decide was an additional factor of vaccine hesitancy; this perception was linked to the co-existence of conflicting information and to the feeling of not having received all the necessary information on risks and benefits of vaccination. The belief of valid alternatives to vaccination was reported by one interviewee, with specific reference to &#x201C;homeopathic vaccines&#x201D;. Results on different exposures to communication regarding vaccines are reported in .  Nearly half of the respondents (49%) were included in the &#x201C;&#x201D;, as they declared having received or looked for information by means of healthcare and non-healthcare sources, as well as having taken part in interactive meetings in small groups during antenatal classes or at birth centres. Among mothers who attended meetings on vaccines, 94% stated that it was a useful experience; among those who did not attend specific meetings, 89% would have appreciated taking part in them. It is noteworthy that among the &#x201C;vaccine-hesitant&#x201D; mothers who did not attend specific meetings on vaccines during the antenatal classes or at birth centres, 87% would have appreciated taking part in them. The chi-squared test for linear trend indicated that attitude towards vaccine hesitancy tends to reduce as exposure to different communicative settings increases (). Vaccine hesitancy reached 26% among mothers who did not remember having received or looked for information; it slightly decreased in mothers who declared having received information by means of different sources (21%), and it showed a considerable decrement in mothers who declared having taken part in specific meetings during antenatal classes or at birth centres (7%). The multivariable logistic regression model showed that socio-demographic variables were not significantly associated with the attitude towards vaccination and they did not show confounding effects; therefore, they were deleted from the model. The odds ratio () values, 95% confidence intervals () and . Exposure to different communication settings was the only variable significantly associated with attitude towards vaccination. Considering the group of the mothers who were exposed in the early setting as the reference group ( = 1), the risk for vaccine hesitancy was tripled for mothers exposed to a conventional communicative setting ( 3.5) and it was quadrupled for mothers who were not exposed to any settings ( = 4.5). This explorative study provides an overview of the vaccination attitudes of mothers of new-borns in Sardinia (Italy), and of its association with previous exposures to different communication settings, and thus contributing to detecting useful clues for triggering experimental studies on strategies for communicating effectively on this relevant topic. In agreement with other studies, the results show that the attitude towards vaccine hesitancy affects about one-fifth of new-born mothers, who express doubts and worry more than totally rejecting all vaccines; this is mainly attributable to the combination of concern and perception of lack of knowledge, in line with other studies []. Additionally, our results support the hypothesis that it could be useful to strengthen institutional communication regarding vaccines in those settings where it is possible to use the interpersonal channel with health professionals. Interpersonal communication could facilitate a process of participatory, empathic communication, based on the exchange of information, knowledge, needs, attitudes, and feelings between the subjects involved []. It is noteworthy that the usefulness of interpersonal communication with health professionals was confirmed by almost all the interviewed vaccine-hesitant mothers who did not take part in any meetings taking place in early settings; indeed, they declared that they would be glad to have this opportunity. This result suggests that the need for interpersonal communication regarding vaccination is relevant in the case of concerns and doubts about vaccines, and confirms the need to make institutional communication regarding vaccines more widespread, expanding the contexts in which it is possible to have face to face communication with health professionals []. It is reasonable to suppose that the communication carried out as part of the prenatal course or at point of birth is associated with a decrease in the tendency to experience vaccine hesitation, not only due to the use of the interpersonal channel, but also due to the timing of communication&#x2014;about three months before the first vaccine session. Our results seem to suggest that interactive meetings in early settings could play a valuable role in facing doubts and concerns that may lead mothers to delay/reject specific vaccines []. Further experimental studies are needed in order to deepen these results and investigate which features of the meetings on vaccines during the prenatal course or at birth point could help in reducing this trend. This study is subject to some potential limitations. A selection bias due to the method used for sample recruiting cannot be excluded, although the terms of payment for hip ultrasound scan (co-payment or free of charge if tax exemption occurs) minimizes this risk; other studies show a similar percentage of vaccine-hesitant mothers, so there is a limited possibility that this bias could have occurred. We cannot exclude the possibility that mothers who attended meetings during prenatal classes or at birth point could be naturally more vaccination-oriented; however, 87% of vaccine-hesitant mothers who did not attend specific meetings in early settings declared that they would have been glad to have this opportunity. A further limitation is represented by the fact that the study does not involve the fathers of new-borns, although the literature suggests a preponderant role of the mother figure in vaccination choices for children. On the whole, this study confirms that both concern and lack of knowledge contribute to trigger vaccine hesitancy in about 20% of new-born mothers. It also shows that the participation in interactive meetings on vaccination during the prenatal course or at birth point could favour a decrease in vaccine hesitancy. These results support the hypothesis that implementing communication regarding vaccines in early settings through interpersonal communication with healthcare staff and peers could be a resource to promote conscious adherence to vaccination. Further experimental studies are needed. Our outcomes are in line with multiple studies that emphasize the strategic role that antenatal settings can play in vaccine communication. These studies bring to light the importance of starting to address the issue of childhood vaccinations during pregnancy in order to support and accompany future mothers towards thoughtful and proper decision-making []. However, we cannot overlook the fact that our assessment of exposure to communication (i.e., participation in interactive meetings) differed from the ones used in that study (i.e., receiving information). Consequently, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the difference between the results of the two studies on the role of communication in the antenatal setting may be affected by the different definition of the variable under study. Moreover, methods for data collection in our study were based on interviews with mothers of children younger than 4 months of age, while in the other study was based on a self-administered questionnaire with parents of children between 16 and 36 months of age; it is not possible to exclude that recall bias had a different weight in the two studies, and it could also influence the evaluation of the association differently. According to several studies, the antenatal period is a crucial phase where it is possible to help parents to deepen and consolidate their knowledge of vaccines; there is some evidence of the importance of highlighting not only the merits of vaccinations for the protection of children&#x2019;s health, but also of fully understanding and meeting parents&#x2019; concerns about the safety of vaccines. However, the specific information and approaches that are effective in communicating knowledge on vaccines with future mothers are not yet clearly defined. Further studies should focus on building a framework that defines the essential features for implementing communication intervention in the antenatal period. This study suggests some implications that could be not only relevant for Italy, but also for other countries with a similar health system and social-economic contexts. According to the World Health Organization () &#x201C. The National Health System could begin to address this challenge by using the available resources in an effective and efficient way. Concern and perceived lack of information play a role in vaccine hesitancy, while communication regarding vaccines implemented in early settings through interpersonal channels could be an enabling factor for vaccine adherence. Considering that prenatal courses and birth points are already active across the national territory, including communication regarding vaccinations among the regular activities of these services could be a proper strategy.

Monitoring the health status of cats ensures their welfare and control of infections transmissible to other domestic and wild animals, as well as to humans. In the present survey, blood samples and ticks were collected, between February 2018 and October 2019, from 85 stray cats living in registered colonies in Emilia Romagna (northern Italy), with the aim of investigating the presence and infection level of a wide range of pathogens transmitted by arthropods (arthropod-borne pathogens&#x2014;s). The collected samples were subjected to serological and -based methods. The presence of pathogens was observed in 71 cats (83.5%) using serological methods and in 47 cats (55.3%) by applying -based analysis. Coinfections (presence of two or more pathogens) were observed in 21 cats (24.7%). While s in privately owned cats are more easily prevented and managed through standard veterinary care, stray cats may be particularly at risk as they live outdoors, have constant exposure to arthropods such as ticks and fleas, and generally do not receive regular antiparasitic treatment. Indeed, the results of the present study show a widespread presence of s, suggesting that stray cats may represent a potential health threat to companion animals and people and the need for improved management. Cats may be affected by a wide range of arthropod-borne pathogens (s) of medical and veterinary interest. Between February 2018 and October 2019, 85 blood samples were collected from stray cats from the Emilia Romagna region (northern Italy). Ticks ( spp. All ticks were negative. A widespread presence of s in the investigated area of northern Italy was shown.

All these diseases should not be overlooked, as, for instance, feline leishmaniosis is increasingly recognized as a disease of cats in endemic areas [ spp., in stray cats from northern Italy (Emilia Romagna region) and in ticks collected on the same animals. Between February 2018 and October 2019, 85 venous blood samples were collected from stray cats (37 females and 48 males), during ovariohysterectomy and orchiectomy activities conducted by veterinarians of the Italian National Health Service (local unit of Bologna). All stray cats belonged to registered colonies of the province of Bologna and Rimini (Emilia Romagna region, northern Italy). No sex, age, or clinical condition inclusion criteria was applied. Body condition score () was evaluated (score 1&#x2013;9) [ for 10 min. Ticks occurring on the examined cats were removed, placed in 1.5 mL tubes with 70% ethanol. Blood, serum, and tick samples were then transferred to the Department of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Pisa for the analytical procedures. Herein, the ticks were morphologically identified []. Serum, blood, and tick samples were stored at &#x2212;20 &#xB0;C until used. An indirect immunofluorescent assay () was carried out to detect antibodies against the investigated bacterial pathogens. Commercial  slides (Fuller Laboratories, Fullerton, , ) with the following coated antigens were used: . A commercial fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-cat immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, , ) diluted 1:50 in Evans Blue (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was used as secondary antibody. Antibody titers of 1:40 and 1:64 were considered the cut-off values for ]. Two-fold dilutions of the positive sera were tested to determine the endpoint titer. An  test was applied for the detection of antibodies against ], using cultured promastigotes fixed on Multiwell glass slides as antigens. Sera were tested starting from a 1:10 dilution. Total  was extracted from the sediment (200 &#xB5;L) obtained after centrifugation of the blood samples and from ticks using the easy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Milano, Italy), following the manufacturer&#x2019;s blood and tissues protocols, respectively. Each  sample was stored at &#x2212;20 &#xB0;C until used in  assays. Different  approaches were employed to detect the investigated pathogens in  extracted from blood and ticks, following the protocols previously described and summarized in ].  assays were performed with Wonder Taq (, Italy) in an automated thermal cycler (Gene-Amp  System 2700, Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, , ).

For  spp. to determine the species involved and as reports of this parasite in Italy are still quite uncommon. The detection rate was calculated for each pathogen and each test, together with the 95% confidence interval (). The overall results of the serological and molecular analysis are reported in ). Overall, the  most frequently scored 5, whereas only a minority of cats scored 7 (5.9%) or 3 (3.5%). A total of 71 (83.5%; 95%  75.6&#x2013;91.4%) sera had antibodies to at least one investigated pathogen. With regard to bacterial pathogens, 39 cats (45.9%; 95%  35.3&#x2013;56.5) were positive for  sp. with a titer 1/10. A total of 47 (55.3%; 95%  44.7&#x2013;65.9%)  samples were positive by  for at least one investigated pathogen. Among these, 25 (29.4%; 95%  19.7&#x2013;39.1%) cats were positive for .

The results of the present study show a widespread presence of s, suggesting that stray cats may represent a potential health threat to companion animals and people and the need for improved management. While these diseases in privately owned cats can be prevented and managed through standard veterinary care, appropriate dewormers, and effective ectoparasiticides, investigating free-roaming, stray, or feral cats may be particularly interesting as they live outdoors, have constant exposure to ticks and fleas, and prey on wildlife that may harbor pathogens. Additionally, stray cats are often neither monitored nor treated for vector-borne pathogens. Considering the obtained results, it would be worthy to conduct further epidemiological surveys investigating other s, responsible for diseases such as rickettsiosis or borreliosis. Knowledge of pathogens in feline populations is helpful for veterinary clinicians in the prevention and control of such agents. Moreover, data about the prevalence of s in feline populations can aid physicians in the diagnosis and control of these zoonotic diseases. Therefore, accurate information on the prevalence of feline pathogens may also be relevant from a One Health perspective.

Potential molecular mechanisms and characteristics of these -specific s were further explored with the help of a new prognostic index based on s developed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator () Cox analysis. A total of 64 hub genes (s associated with prognosis) were markedly associated with the clinical outcome of  patients. G functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were actively involved in several pathways, e.g., cytokine&#x2013;cytokine receptor interaction, T-cell receptor signaling, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. -based prognostic signatures performed moderately in prognostic predictions. Interestingly, the prognostic index based on s reflected infiltration by several types of immune cells. These data screened several s of clinical significance and revealed drivers of the immune repertoire, demonstrating the importance of a personalized -based immune signature in the recognition, surveillance, and prognosis of  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma () encompasses a heterogeneous group of epithelial malignancies that arise in the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx (). Existing treatments are insufficient for patients with locally advanced or distantly metastatic  Careful monitoring of the progression of  with the help of novel and sensitive biomarkers could reduce the number of  patients not diagnosed before the onset of aggressive disease. In the middle of the last century, Burnt and Thomas proposed the theory of immune surveillance, which suggests that the immune system of the host can recognize precursors of cancer and, in most cases, destroy these precursors before they become clinically apparent (). s play a vital role in the immune system that can control the immune response, including cytokine-related genes, chemokine-related genes, and other cell surface antigen genes. However, the clinical relevance and prognostic significance of s in  are still elusive. In this study,  expression profiles were integrated with clinical information by computational methods for the evaluation of overall survival () in  patients with the goal of gaining insight into the potential clinical application of s in prognostic stratification and their implicational potential as biomarkers for targeted  therapy. On this basis, the expression status and prognostic landscape of s were systematically analyzed, and an individualized prognostic signature for  patients was developed. The underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms were explored by bioinformatics. This study lays a theoretical foundation for further understanding the pathophysiological process and clinical individualized treatment of  Transcriptome -sequencing data of 499 primary  and 44 non-tumor tissue samples were acquired from A data portal). To filter s involved in the incidence of , differentially expressed s between  and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples were screened  | fold change| &gt; 1 were chosen as the cutoff values for differential gene analysis of all transcriptional data.

The prognostic value of the  was assessed in patients with different subtypes of  The  online database stored abundance information of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and provide useful interfaces for analyzing and visualizing them ( T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (s) from 10,897 samples across 32 cancer types from  Therefore, it can be easily employed for determining the relationship between immune cell infiltration with cancer prognosis. In this study, the associations between immune infiltrate levels of  samples and their  level were calculated. Gene functional enrichment analyses were conducted based on the R software cluster Profiler package for identifying biological themes among gene clusters (). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test identified 4,793 differentially expressed genes, of which 3,611 were upregulated and 1,182 were downregulated (). Differentially expressed immune-related genes (). The heat map , differentially expressed s are shown. The red dot indicates the highly expressed genes, the green dot indicates the downregulated genes, and the black dot indicates the genes with no difference. Disease stage and classification are important bases for clinical decision-making and individualized therapy; therefore, one of the main targets of this study is to identify potential molecular biomarkers that could serve as significant clinical prognostic indicators. Univariate Cox analysis identified 236 s that have significant correlations with  in  patients. As predicted, gene functional enrichment analysis confirmed that the immune response was most frequently implicated. The most frequently appearing biological terms among biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions are &#x201C;inflammatory response,&#x201D; &#x201C;plasma membrane,&#x201D; and &#x201C;cytokine activity&#x201D; (). Gene function enrichment of immune-related genes related to survival.  The 10 most significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (G) signaling pathways.

To investigate potential molecular mechanisms correlated with the clinical significance of the hub s, we analyzed the regulatory mechanisms of these genes.

Among them, the triangle represents s, the green circle represents core immune genes related to good prognosis, and the red circle represents immune genes related to poor prognosis.

To investigate whether our prognostic signature can reflect the state of  patients&#x2019; tumor immune microenvironment, we evaluated the components of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in  tissues and analyzed the correlation between the risk score and the fractions of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. With an increase in the risk score, the fractions of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (8).

It is well known that immune cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment are considered to perform key roles in the biological behaviors of solid cancers, which are closely associated with clinical prognosis. Although the significance of s in cancer generation and progression as well as immunotherapy has been proven, an integrative, genome-wide profiling model correlated to their clinical significance and molecular mechanisms is not well established. This comprehensive analysis of s in  helps us to understand their clinical significance and underlying molecular characteristics. A large number of  tissue samples are available from A database, which ensures that the results of this study are reliable enough. The present study identified several s significantly involved in the generation and progression of  that could serve as potential valuable clinical biomarkers. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanisms were explored by bioinformatics analyses. Importantly, a selected differentially expressed -based personalization immune prognostic signature was developed for defining immune cell infiltration, and its potential clinical application value was explored. Although there is a deeper understanding of tumorigenesis and tumor immunology, many aspects of  immune-related molecular mechanisms are not well elaborated. Immunologically, the malignant transformation of cells is closely related to chronic inflammation of the local microenvironment; therefore, this study was focused on hub genes (s associated with prognosis). Several studies have found differentially expressed genes between  and non-tumor tissue samples (), providing intrinsic insight into the pathogenesis of  at the genetic level. However, the characteristics of s in  have not been comprehensively investigated to date. Here, we concentrated on  s and signaling pathways by combining immunogenomic profiles with their corresponding clinical significance to describe the immune status of  more comprehensively. Through univariate Cox analysis, we found that 236 s were closely related to the  of  patients, indicating that s are very important for the prognosis of  patients. 26, A3G, 1, T, H1, , and 70 genes are related to the  of , which is consistent with the results of ), leading to  diffusion and poor prognosis; however, this needs to be verified by subsequent experiments. In addition, we identified 64 differentially expressed and prognosis-related s as core genes, including six chemokine-related genes, six -related genes, 12 growth factor-related genes, five protease-related genes, seven T- and B-cell surface molecule-related genes, six kinase-related genes, and 22 genes encoding other proteins (). In summary, the core s involve tumor-related pathways including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (3K)/, -&#x3;B, Notch, Wnt, /T, -&#x3B2;/Smad, , and /K pathways. The 5 growth factor-related genes (&#x3B1;, 12&#x3B1;, 25, 4, and 9) and C5, 3, and  all play key roles in the occurrence and development of  mediated by the -&#x3;B pathway. To explore the regulatory mechanism of the abnormal expression of s in , we constructed a regulatory network of core s and tumor-related s. The results showed that P3, T1, T2, I2, and  play core roles in the network. Foxp3 regulates the differentiation and function of Tregs and coregulates Treg maturation with T-cell receptor () signaling (). 1 enhances  binding and plays a role in the carcinogenesis of  In the  network analysis, the s Foxp3 and I2 were found to participate in regulating the expression and silencing of some core genes, providing some references for research on the genesis and development mechanism of  It is worth mentioning that we used univariate Cox to analyze the prognosis based on s and then used  Cox analysis to build the prognostic model. The results show that this model can well distinguish patients with different clinical results. We further evaluated its reliability by  curve analysis (the  of the  curve was 0.742). Compared with , who only used Cox regression to establish a prognosis model for thyroid cancer, after we added  regression based on Cox regression, many genes with unique values were found to control the complexity of the model through the parameter &#x3; to avoid overfitting. Moreover, the prognostic markers we constructed can be used as independent predictors after clinical parameter correction, yielding high clinical applicability for the prediction of  development. The establishment of an  prognostic model based on s provides a reference for clinical treatment, which is not only helpful to assess patient condition but also helpful to further elucidate the functions of s. The theory of tumor immune escape suggests that the process of tumor generation and development can be divided into three stages: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells play an important role in this process. It is known that tumor-infiltrating immune cells are prognostic factors for different types of cancer, and their number and type can reflect the type of immune response in the tumor microenvironment, which is heterogeneous (), while the presence of s might activate the immune monitoring system, facilitate ingestion and presentation of tumor antigens, and induce an antitumor immune response. However, there are a few limitations in this study. First, we only used the expression data and clinical information of the  queue in A database, and we should also use other databases [such as the Gene Expression Omnibus () database] for verification. Second, the molecular mechanisms of these s involved in the occurrence and development of  need to be further studied by  experiments. Finally, the  of  was 0.742, suggesting that the model has moderate potential for the prognostic signature based on s in survival monitoring. The model could divide patients into the high-risk group and low-risk group and predict the survival outcomes of  patients. However, it is not high enough for clinical practice. We will collect clinic samples of  patients in the next period to optimize the model and improve the value of . In conclusion, we explored the core s that may play important roles in the development of  and further revealed the potential regulatory mechanisms of these core s. In addition, we constructed an ideal prognosis model through  Cox. These results are helpful for developing individualized treatment plans and new treatment targets for  patients.

Despite multimodal treatment with maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent radiochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide, the prognosis remains poor with a median survival of 1 year. The survival rate at 5 years is 5% and, theoretically, all glioblastomas relapse []. Because the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma remains a highly unmet clinical need, deeper mechanistic insight into the molecular changes present in these tumors is required. The enrollment of recurrent glioblastoma patients in clinical trials investigating new therapeutic options should be considered carefully whenever possible. In this Special Issue, we present some of the exciting updates on recurrent glioblastomas, which may help shape future treatment options. In recent years, immunotherapy, especially the immune checkpoint inhibitors (s) nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and durvalumab, showed durable improved outcomes in several types of tumors but not in the overall glioblastoma population []. Several clinical trials have evaluated the activity of molecular targeted therapies, mostly tyrosine kinase inhibitors (s), which can block the biological mechanism implicated in cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The F protein is involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (K) pathway, and the most frequent mutation in the F gene results in V600 The frequency of this mutation in glioblastoma is about 3%; in specific subgroups of glioblastoma, such as epithelioid glioblastoma, it can reach 50%. Vemurafenib, a potent F V600E inhibitor, was analyzed in the - trial, reporting promising results. In this study [], a phase  basket study, analyzed this combination in many types of tumors including 39 recurrent high-grade gliomas with F V600E mutation; the results were interesting, with an  of 27% (95% , 13.8&#x2013;44.1), including one complete response and a disease control rate () of 57%. Another important success in recurrent glioblastoma patients is attributed to larotrectinib, a selective  inhibitor. A study analyzed 18 cases with primary brain tumors, including six patients with recurrent glioblastoma, reporting a  of 100% []. Regorafenib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor of 1,2,3,  2, , R, , -1, , and F, was evaluated in the  trial, a randomized phase  study enrolling 119 recurrent glioblastoma patients []. At present, the Italian prospective and observational study -Oss and the international phase  study   are ongoing to confirm and evaluate the benefit of regorafenib in recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. Of note, regorafenib can decrease the presence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells within the tumor; thus, it may increase the efficacy of s. Based on this rationale, a new basket trial (Bayer 21136) will evaluate the combination of regorafenib plus nivolumab in many types of tumors, including recurrent glioblastoma. The combination of s and s was recently studied in the P-005 basket trial; this trial enrolled 31 recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It reported impressive results for recurrent glioblastoma with an  and  of 16.1% (95% , 5.5&#x2013;33.7) and 58.1% (95% , 39.1&#x2013;75.5), respectively. Despite these encouraging results, many other studies analyzing targeted therapies, such as agents targeting c-, the 3K&#x2013;&#x2013;m pathway, R, and R inhibitors, failed to improve outcomes in recurrent glioblastoma patients []; trials at tumor recurrence are usually based on molecular data from the primary tumor, with the potential loss of original mutations at relapse. In conclusion, although the cornerstone of treatment in newly diagnosed glioblastoma remains radiochemotherapy with temozolomide, we are seeing some promising results in the setting of recurrent glioblastoma due to specific targeted therapies (i.e., F inhibitors,  inhibitors, and regorafenib) alone or combined with immunotherapy in subpopulations of recurrent glioblastoma patients based on phase  clinical trials. The benefit of these new treatments needs further evaluation including: (i) larger phase  studies or trials based on new statistical approaches and (ii) companion tests examining predictors of response.

In 2009, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent glioblastoma in the . To evaluate the clinical impact of bevacizumab as a first-line drug for glioblastoma, two randomized clinical trials, glio and G 0825, were performed. Bevacizumab was found to improve progression-free survival () and was reported to be beneficial for maintaining patient performance status as an initial treatment. These outcomes led to bevacizumab approval in Japan in 2013 as an insurance-covered first-line drug for glioblastoma concurrently with its second-line application. However, prolongation of overall survival was not evinced in these clinical trials; hence, the clinical benefit of bevacizumab for newly diagnosed glioblastomas remains controversial. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of bevacizumab combined with temozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma also showed an effect only on , and the benefit of bevacizumab even for recurrent glioblastoma is controversial. Here, we discuss the clinical impact of bevacizumab for glioblastoma treatment by reviewing previous clinical trials and real-world evidence by focusing on Japanese experiences. Moreover, the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab are summarized, and we provide suggestions for updating the approaches and management of bevacizumab. Glioblastoma () is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and is known to have one of the most dismal prognoses in cancer. The conventional standard treatment for newly diagnosed  was established in 2005 when a multimodal treatment consisting of maximal safe resection, concomitant temozolomide () and radiotherapy, followed by adjuvant  showed improvements in  prognosis []. However, despite aggressive and advanced treatment strategies, the prognosis of patients with  remains poor. Notably, multidisciplinary treatment options for  are limited compared with other carcinomas; therefore, there is a significant need for identifying and assessing putative treatment options for these patients. Neo-angiogenesis in  suggests a possible utility for anti-angiogenic therapies. Malignant gliomas are known to have a hypervascular nature and high expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (F) []. Bevacizumab () is a molecular-targeted drug that inhibits angiogenesis by interrupting the F/F-receptor signaling pathway and leads to indirect antitumor activity []. However, the survival benefit of  for patients with  remains controversial due to a lack of clear evidence. To evaluate the clinical impact of  as a first-line drug for , two randomized clinical trials, glio and G 0825, were performed. These clinical trials indicated that  as an initial treatment improves the progression-free survival () of patients with  [] and that the benefit of  even for recurrent  is controversial. In this review, we discuss the clinical impact of  for the treatment of  by reviewing previous clinical trials and real-world evidence by focusing on Japanese experiences. Moreover, the efficacy and safety of  are summarized, and we provide suggestions for updating the approaches and management of . The two randomized phase  clinical trials glio and G 0825 failed to prove the impact of  on the  of patients with newly diagnosed  []. This suggests that a favorable impact of  can be observed when clinical trials are designed to evaluate its efficacy for patients with severe conditions. ]. Overall, the results indicate that, although  may have some clinical benefit for severe clinical conditions, such as unresectable tumors or advanced age, there is no sufficient evidence in these clinical trials. Few clinical trials can provide sufficient evidence of the benefit of  for newly diagnosed  because a favorable impact of  can be demonstrated in patients with more severe conditions that tend to be obstructive for enrolment in randomized trials. Accordingly, real-world data from retrospective studies conducted by Japanese institutions appear promising in providing evidence of first-line  efficacy for patients with severe clinical conditions. Yonezawa et al. []. The paradoxical  and  results of randomized phase  clinical trials []. Nevertheless, the evidence level is not sufficiently high as these reports are institutional and retrospective studies, and  usage is institution-specific. Moreover, the  has approved  use only for recurrent , whereas first-line  concurrent with its second-line application has been approved only in Japan. The unique  approval in Japan, regardless of clinical stage, has had a positive impact on the survival of specific patients. Further accumulation of evidence in addition to clinical data, such as from Japanese cohorts, is warranted to evaluate the real-world impact of  therapy. Various phase  clinical trials with  have shown promising results in terms of  of recurrent  []. Although  prolongation was not evinced and the clinical benefit of  for  remains controversial,  continues to be used in some settings, especially for recurrent s that have failed standard therapies or do not qualify for targeted therapies. Recent studies have reported on the usage of , such as the dose, timing, and combined treatment options for patients with .  prevents the growth of new blood vessels, resulting in suppressed tumor growth. Because this anti-tumor effect only has an indirect impact on  growth,  in combination with cytotoxic agents, which have a direct impact, has been well studied. However, no studies have provided sufficient evidence supporting the efficacy of combination therapy with these agents. Over the past 10 years, several phase  studies have investigated  in combination with various agents, including irinotecan, cetuximab, carboplatin, erlotinib, sorafenib, and dasatinib [ = 0.38).

In addition to evaluating first-line , further efforts to address the appropriate usage of  for patients with recurrent , including dose, timing, and combined agents, are required to maximize the clinical benefits of . Recently, population-based analyses were conducted to investigate changes in the survival of patients with . For example, a 2018 study compared  between patients diagnosed with  before and after  approval using  population-based cancer registry data (R) [ = 10,701), and concluded that the  of patients with  has steadily improved, likely resulting from the administration of  concomitant with radiotherapy for newly diagnosed  and then  for recurrent  after its  approval. In Japan, similar investigations are currently underway. In 2002, the Japanese government introduced a per diem prospective payment system with a diagnosis-related group-like grouping, termed Diagnostic Procedure Combination () []. Because first-line  is approved only in Japan, and Japanese  usage is unique, the population-based analysis of Japanese real-world data may provide indirect evidence validating the efficacy of  treatment. We are currently analyzing the  database and planning to report the current trend in  treatment after  approval in Japan. Population-based analysis of further real-world data can accumulate sufficient evidence to support  usage. The evaluation of  recurrence is complicated by treatment-induced changes and discordance between enhancing and non-enhancing magnetic resonance imaging () []. Numerous studies have reported atypical patterns of progression after  treatment, such as multifocal and widely disseminated disease, and there are concerns that  increases the risk of concomitantly eliciting tumor adaptation and progression to stages with greater malignancy and heightened invasiveness [], and the impact of  on relapse pattern is controversial. ] adopted a similar classification and demonstrated that non-enhancing infiltration after  treatment is not associated with worse prognosis (primary non-responder vs. flare-up of  vs. non-enhancing infiltration median : 4.4 vs. 11.0 vs. 9.0) and that discontinuation of therapy can aggravate the clinical course. Although atypical patterns of progression after  treatment, such as multifocal and widely disseminated disease, have been noted, Chamberlain [] compared the progression pattern of first-line  with that of second-line or later, and found no difference in progression patterns between these groups. In our cohort, atypical relapse patterns, including non-enhancing tumor or diffuse progression, increased after  approval, but they did not significantly influence the survival of patients with , as was the case in other studies. Taken these findings into consideration, the hypotheses that  accelerates aggressive disseminated progression and that non-enhancing tumors are correlated with worse survival are not consistent. glio subanalysis indicated that the benefit of  on  occurred only in patients with newly diagnosed  who had pro-neural ]. For some newly diagnosed ,  may have clinical benefits. Although predictive markers of  have been reported, there is no sufficient evidence. To confirm the reproducibility of these markers, further real-world data need to be accumulated and validated. Both glio and G 0825 included an optional biomarker component. Preliminary analysis in the glio study did not identify a predictive value for baseline plasma F-A or F receptor-2 [ homozygous deletions. In addition to these genetic markers, some imaging markers have been recently reported. Representative imaging markers include enhancing tumor volume measurements, relative cerebral blood volume variation, perfusion maps, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted subtraction maps [] demonstrated that diffusional kurtosis imaging, which is an extension of diffuse tensor imaging, allows the detection of tissue changes 28 days after initiating  treatment and may provide information regarding tumor progression. A recent study reported that basal neutrophils and regular T cells in peripheral venous blood are significantly associated with survival during treatment with  []. There are several potential therapeutic advantages of anti-angiogenic therapies, including , in the treatment of . Previous clinical data suggest that patients whose tumor perfusion or oxygenation increases in response to anti-angiogenic therapies may actually survive longer; hence, strategies aimed at alleviating tumor hypoxia while improving perfusion may enhance the outcome of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy []. Because the newly formed vasculature of  has a selective vulnerability, anti-angiogenic therapies show tumor selectivity and there is less concern about drug delivery [].  is known to enhance the effects of immunotherapy because F-A suppresses antitumor immunity by inhibiting the maturation of dendritic cells and stimulating the proliferation of regulatory T cells [] demonstrated that  downregulates the expression of programmed cell death-1 (-1) and -L1 immune checkpoint molecules and decreases the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. It is well known that  can prevent symptomatic radiation necrosis through decreased vascular permeability []. Further clinical studies are necessary to determine the extent to which aggressive radiotherapy in combination with  is allowed. Blocking the F pathway restores tumor vasculature to a more normal state, reducing vascular permeability and the regional cerebral blood volume around the tumor [] conducted an epidemiological study including 310 patients with  in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, and reported that the baseline dose of corticosteroids was reduced by more than half in 83% of patients on  compared with 48% of patients treated with -free regimens. The anti-oedematous effect of  may also be associated with the maintenance of  in patients with  []. Common and significant toxicities of  include hypertension, proteinuria, risk of renal failure, posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, venous and arterial thromboembolic disease, bowel perforation, and poor wound healing []. Because data on the occurrence and optimal management of these treatment-related complications in patients with  are limited, management is based on data collected from the experiences of patients with a variety of systemic cancers. Therefore, we need to establish appropriate  management for patients with  in the future.

We speculate that our adaptable treatment strategy, first-line  optimized for patients with severe clinical conditions and allowing  tapering/discontinuation depending on clinical status, maximizes the advantages of the unique  approval in Japan and leads to favorable outcomes that were not achieved in clinical trials due to stringent treatment protocols.

They colonize a variety of habitats from wet tropical forests to semi-arid and desert areas. Adult individuals feed mainly on small mammals, and less often on birds. The aim of the present study was to explore the fauna of fleas and their broad-sense behavior in eastern Poland. Rodents, which are widely recognized as one of the preferred hosts of these insects, were caught to carry out the study. The results show that, regardless of the ecological habitat type, the striped field mouse  flea species was collected most frequently. Moreover, rhythms in the seasonal activity of fleas, with a peak in summer months, were noted. Fleas (Siphonaptera) are cosmopolitan, secondarily wingless, hematophagous insects with laterally flattened body symmetry. To date, over 2500 species of fleas representing 238 genera have been described worldwide []. Due to their broad host range and the ability to infest different hosts during their lifespan, which is typical for these insects (most species are polyzoic), fleas play an important role as reservoirs of pathogens []. Fleabites are manifested by skin lesions, usually red itchy blisters that provoke scratching []. To date, little research has been conducted in Poland to study the distribution, seasonal activity, and host preferences of fleas. The investigations were mainly carried out in the northern areas of the country, where fleas were collected from rodents trapped in forest areas located along the Baltic coast and on forestless sea dunes []. However, to the best of our knowledge, the available literature provides no data on the seasonal activity of fleas in this area. There are no published results of studies conducted simultaneously in different habitats. The aim of the present study was to identify the species composition and host preferences of fleas with simultaneous determination of the abundance and rhythms of the seasonal activity of local flea populations present in habitats of eastern Poland (Lublin Province). The study was conducted in 3 different ecological habitats in eastern Poland (Lublin Province) in established plots marked with A, B and C (). Plot A (51&#xB0;16&#x2032;24&#x2033; N; 22&#xB0;32&#x2032;04&#x2033; E) is located in the immediate vicinity of a residential area within the administrative boundaries of the city of Lublin (approximately 320,000 inhabitants). The area is a recreation site for city residents. It is mostly covered by grassland vegetation with patches of  spp. trees. Plot B (51&#xB0;21&#x2032;15&#x2033; N; 22&#xB0;45&#x2032;39&#x2033; E) is part of an unused meadow characterized by progressive ecological succession and located along the Wieprz River, i.e., one of the longest rivers in eastern Poland. The area comprises patches of  spp. shrubs, and the area surrounding the plot is characterized by an open mosaic-like landscape consisting of sporadically mown meadows and unused crop fields. Plot C (51&#xB0;36&#x2032;41&#x2033; N; 22&#xB0;22&#x2032;30&#x2033; E) is located within a fallow near a mixed forest. It is characterized by clearly progressive ecological succession with predominance of volunteer  trees. The number of animals to be captured was based on the 3R principle (refining, reducing, replacing) to limit the number of animals used in the experiment to a minimum ensuring consistent and reliable results. The rodents were trapped at monthly intervals from May to October 2019. Each time, 40 non-destructive traps (Model S1, R-Max, Mr&#x105;gowo, Poland) were set up in the plots. The traps were placed at 2-m spacing, thus creating a rectangle with 16 m &#xD7; 10 m sides and an area of 160 m]. The bodies of the dead animals were disposed of by a specialized company (Bacutil, Zastawie, Poland).  Due to the seasonality, the field study was conducted from May to October. To prevent hypothermia-induced death of trapped animals, we captured the rodents during the vegetation season on days with a minimum temperature of 10 &#xB0;C and not in the period with night frosts. Rodent populations have been studied in a similar period of the year in other regions of Poland [].  The study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee in Lublin, decision no. 7/28/2018 and the Director of the Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection in Lublin, decision no. .6401.51.2017 Dead animals were placed in plastic sterile 100-cm]. After the analyses, the specimens were deposited in the laboratory archives of the Chair and Department of Biology and Parasitology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.  A Data Logger R6030 device (Reed Instruments, Wilmington, , ) for recording of temperature and relative air humidity was placed in each of the plots. The prevailing weather conditions were recorded at 1 h intervals. After completion of the field studies, the data were read and analyzed. The statistical tests were chosen on the basis of the characteristics of the distribution of the analyzed variables. The relationships between the number of collected females and males of each flea species were tested with the -test for 2 independent means. The seasonal activity of fleas between plots was checked using one-way  for independent means. The differences in the weather conditions between the analyzed plots were verified with the Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis test. In all tests, the value of  &#x2264; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed using the A 10 package (StatSoft,  Software Inc., Palo Alto, , ).  In total, four species of fleas were collected in the study sites. The plots located in the non-urban areas were characterized by greater species richness and abundance of the flea fauna than the plot located in the city (). ). The structure of the local flea populations exhibited a tendency towards a greater number of males than females, but it was not statistically significant in any case ().  There were statistically significant differences in the number of fleas collected between the flea populations analyzed (). Flea specimens were most frequently collected from the field mouse ).  The highest level of flea infestation was observed in the ).  In plot A, the presence of at least one flea species was found in 85.7% of the rodents. This percentage was 97.7% in plot B and 91.0% in plot  In plot A, higher infestation rates were recorded in ).  Depending on the habitat, the average air temperature measured at the ground level throughout the study ranged from 14.0 &#xB0;C (plot B) to 17.0 &#xB0;C (plot A). The mean relative air humidity in this period ranged from 61.1% (plot A) to 77.0% (plot B).  The analyzed habitats did not differ significantly in terms of the thermal conditions (H = 2.350,  = 0.011).  The results of our investigations show that, regardless of the ecological type of the habitat (urban and non-urban habitats), the striped field mouse ].  We observed higher numbers of ]. In turn, the common vole ]. In the study area, we detected the presence of four species of fleas ().  The investigated flea populations are characterized by distinct rhythms of seasonal activity.

Therefore, we aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting the probability of negative prognosis in aged patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing thrombectomy. In addition, we sought to investigate the association between histological thrombus composition and stroke characteristics. To this end, we prospectively studied a developed cohort using data collected from a stroke center from November 2015 to December 2019. The main outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin&#x2009;Scale&#x2009;score &#x2264; 2 at 90 days following a mechanical thrombectomy. A nomogram model based on multivariate logistic models was generated. The retrieved thrombi were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and assessed according to histological composition. Our results demonstrated that age &#x2265; 72&#x2009;years was independently associated with poor outcome. A total of 304 participants completed the follow-up data to generate the nomogram model. After multivariate logistic regression, five variables remained independent predictors of outcome, including older age, hemorrhagic transformation, thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score, National Institute of Health Stroke score, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and were used to generate the nomogram. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.803. The clots from elderly subjects with large-artery atherosclerosis, anterior circulation, and successful recanalization groups had a higher percentage of fibrin compared to those of younger patients. This is the first nomogram to be developed and validated in a stroke center cohort for individualized prediction of poor outcome in elderly patients after mechanical thrombectomy. Clot composition provides valuable information on the underlying pathogenesis of oxidation in older patients. Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability and mortality in China, and its incidence increases with age [], but its relation to outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy in older patients is less well established. Nomograms are useful tools for clinicians to make a visualized and quick risk assessment and have been widely used for clinical decision-making in patients [], and further validation is necessary among the elderly. The main objective of this study was to develop a nomogram model to predict poor outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy at an older age and to compare the diversity of histological thrombus composition. This was a longitudinal, prediction model development and validation study, which included data from a stroke center from November 2015 to December 2019. Participants were enrolled if they met the following criteria: age &#x2265; 18&#x2009;years, with anterior or posterior circulation stroke, irrespective of National Institute of Health Stroke () score at presentation and whether intravenous thrombolysis was performed. Patients were excluded if they were treated with intravenous thrombolysis only, missed key outcome data, or had follow-up loss at 3 months. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital (Shanghai, China) and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants and their caregivers provided written informed consent. The main outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified&#x2009;Rankin&#x2009;Scale&#x2009;(m)&#x2009;score &#x2264; 2 90 days following a mechanical thrombectomy. Demographic and clinical data and procedural characteristics were collected at admission, as in our previous study []. As described in our previous study, all formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded thrombi were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin []. The percentages of red blood cells (s), white blood cells (s), and fibrin in retrieved thrombi were analyzed by two experienced pathologists (F and ) who were blinded to the clinical data and imaging findings. A total of 322 patients enrolled in the present study were scheduled for an outpatient follow-up at 3 months. Follow-up of the m at 3 months was conducted by telephone or at a stroke follow-up clinic. Finally, 302 subjects (93.8%) took part in the follow-up visit. The remaining 20 subjects were lost to follow-up, among whom 12 had travelled out of Shanghai and 8 refused follow-up. Descriptive statistics and univariate comparisons were used for statistical analysis. Comparisons were performed using Student's -index, which is equivalent to the -. Finally, calibration curves were plotted to assess the calibration of the nomogram by comparing the observed probability of negative outcome after endovascular thrombectomy according to the total score of the nomogram against the predicted probability based on the nomogram. A significant test statistic implied that the model was calibrated perfectly. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate whether the observed event rates matched the expected rates. Statistical analyses were performed using S v26 ( Corporation, New York, ) and GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, , ). A total of 322 patients who met the inclusion criteria completed the follow-up visit at 90 days. The mean age of the patients was 69 &#xB1; 11&#x2009;years, and 43.4% were women. The average symptom onset-to-groin time was nearly 422&#x2009;min, and the mean  score at presentation was 14.4 &#xB1; 4.6. Posterior circulation stroke was treated in 18.2% of the patients. Successful reperfusion with I &#x2265; 2b was reported in 87.7% of subjects, and the overall rate of s was 31%. A good outcome (m score, 0&#x2013;2) was observed in 39.1% of the cases at 90 days, and the overall mortality at 90 days was 24.4%. The  correlating age and probability of poor outcomes showed optimal sensitivity and specificity trade-off at the age of 72 years. Therefore, patients were grouped by age according to the cut-off point of 72 years, and the elderly were defined as those aged &#x2265; 72&#x2009;years. The average age in the elderly group was 79 &#xB1; 5&#x2009;years compared with 61 &#xB1; 8&#x2009;years in the younger population. Univariate analysis showed a significantly higher percentage of women in the elderly group (65% vs. 28%, ). In multivariate regression analysis, age &#x2265; 72 correlated with significantly higher odds of poor outcome ( = 2.25, ). To determine if a specific clinical subgroup of subjects was associated with a higher risk of poor outcome, we performed multivariate analysis to predict an m score &#x2265; 2 at 90 days on the basis of stroke location, the extent of recanalization (I score), and stroke subtypes. When patients were grouped by location (anterior or posterior circulation stroke), age at presentation of &#x2265;72 was associated with lower odds of good outcomes in the anterior circulation ( = 2.52, ). Additionally, when patients were grouped according to stroke location, subtype, and etiology, a high  showed an independent association with a higher likelihood of poor prognosis. Hypertension and diabetes did not achieve significance as variables in the binary logistic regression model and were eliminated. Five potential predictors yielded by the binomial logistic regression model ( method) included age &#x2265; 72 ( = 2.25; 95% , 1.20&#x2013;4.25), I score ( = 0.32; 95% , 0.11&#x2013;0.91),  score ( = 1.16; 95% , 1.08&#x2013;1.24), s ( = 4.9; 95% , 2.54&#x2013;9.45), and  ( = 2.27; 95% , 1.27&#x2013;4.07). A prediction model was established using the nomogram based on these five factors, and a summary of the point value of each factor used to calculate the total score is presented in . The - curve of the prediction model was 0.803, with a sensitivity of 67.9% and specificity of 82.8%. The calibration curve of the nomogram for the predicted probability of negative outcome after endovascular thrombectomy at older age in this cohort is shown in . The results of the 1,000 bootstrap samples estimated the  to be 0.791, which suggested good discrimination of the model. Of the 147 materials collected from the occlusion artery, clots were classified as cardioembolism and . As shown in ). Our findings suggest that an older age of &#x2265;72 years is independently associated with poor outcomes despite comparable clinical characteristics and procedural variables. We present a precise nomogram model based on older age, hemorrhagic transformation, the I score, the  score, and  to predict the probability of poor outcomes following mechanical thrombectomy. This model provides clinicians with a useful tool for quick and individualized preoperative risk assessment in elderly patients aged &#x2265;72 years. The negative prognostic effect of older age persisted despite anterior circulation, cardioembolic etiology, and successful recanalization (I &#x2265; 2b). We demonstrate that an age of &#x2265;72 years is a negative predictor of poor outcome in patients with anterior circulation occlusion but does not independently predict an increased rate of functional dependence in the posterior circulation group. Our findings and those of previous studies have consistently shown that age is an independent predictor of functional independence and mortality after thrombectomy in elderly patients with acute anterior circulation stroke []. Our study further strengthens the importance of the  in predicting clinical outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy. An important result in the present study was the establishment of a nomogram model to predict functional outcome and mortality, as this has not been reported previously among survivors aged &#x2265; 72&#x2009;years. This model showed good discrimination and calibration, indicating that the predictive power is as good as representing actual risk. The verification of the internal validation group (training group) by bootstrap analysis further confirmed the reliability of the present nomogram. Although several studies have examined the relationship between risk predictors and stroke outcome after mechanical thrombectomy []. In contrast to the risk group, a nomogram model provides a visualized and individualized estimate of the prediction probability of a specific outcome for an individual patient, as well as an important tool of medical decision-making based on the individual's disease characteristics. Thus, this model, showing good predicting ability, can be used by clinicians to increase confidence in their preprocedure risk assessment. Although our primary goal was to develop a nomogram model to predict poor outcome after mechanical thrombectomy at an older age, we also investigated differences in the histological characteristics of thrombi between the two age groups. Our results demonstrate that age at presentation &#x2265;72 years was associated with a higher proportion of fibrin in thrombi than those &lt;72 years in anterior circulation, cardioembolic etiology, and successful recanalization. Increased plasma fibrin levels have been reported to be associated with a significantly higher risk of major stroke events in aged patients []. Thus, fibrin-rich thrombi may be a potential oxidative marker of older patients with large vessel occlusion undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The major strengths of our study include the development of a readily available and rapid tool, which can facilitate individual preprocedure identification of negative outcomes at older age, as well as homogeneous histological analysis in the included patients. However, this study has some limitations. First, this study is a single-center, observational study with a natural bias, and if possible, an external validation in a multicenter cohort with a larger patient number should be considered. Second, the relationship between functional outcome and plasma  may be dynamic and may be influenced by multiple variables such as diet or fever, which may have influenced the results. The dynamic  data will be considered in future studies because of its more effective predicting ability. Finally, the components of the retrieved thrombi might not completely reflect those of the entire thrombus, and although we attempted to exclude this unavoidable bias, this influence should be considered. This study provides an easy-to-use nomogram model to predict poor outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy at an older age of &#x2265;72 years. This nomogram provides clinicians with a new tool that is more useful for the visualization of risk for each individual than traditional risk scores in the preprocedure decision-making process. In addition, we found more fibrin-rich thrombi among elderly survivors undergoing mechanical thrombectomy, suggesting that oxidative stress links older age to neurological dysfunction. Future studies are warranted to investigate this potential target in elderly stroke patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.

Blood samples were collected from 188 free-roaming dogs and cats in Asir (70 dogs and 44 cats) and Riyadh (74 dogs), Saudi Arabia. The presence of  was detected in 17 dogs (24.28%), while coinfections were not detected in cats. These results suggest that effective control and public awareness strategies for minimizing infection in animals are necessary. Vector-borne pathogens (s) transmitted by ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes, are of global importance especially in the case of zoonotic infections which pose a direct threat to human health and animal welfare [ (Latreille, 1806) sensu lato (s.l.). While much of the country is similarly hot and dry, the coastal areas of Saudi Arabia and those at higher altitudes may be more accommodating to parasites capable of  transmission. Investigations into ectoparasite and  prevalence in these regions, however, remain lacking, which makes the impact of s on animal and human populations difficult to quantify. Scant scientific information is available regarding the tick fauna of dogs and cats in Saudi Arabia and the pathogens they harbor. Two tick species, ].  Likewise, there are no data on the fleas of dogs and cats in Saudi Arabia and the flea-borne infections in these animals. Fleas are vectors and intermediate hosts of various bacteria (e.g., hemotropic ]. However, there is no information about the prevalence of bartonellosis in dogs and cats in this country.  In previous studies from the Riyadh Province, the tested dogs&#x2019; blood  samples were found infected with s []. Hence, the aim of the current study was to add to the existing knowledge on the identity, prevalence, and distribution of s in Saudi Arabia by screening free roaming dogs and cats from two locations, one temperate and one semi-arid (Riyadh and Asir Provinces, respectively). Multiplex tandem real-time  (-) revealed that dogs from the Riyadh Province tested negative for all the pathogens; however, 46 out of 70 dogs (65.7%) from the Asir Province were -positive for at least one of the tested pathogens, i.e.,  was detected in 17 dogs (24.3%).  The nucleotide sequences of  sequence (accession number 280824) was 100% identical to isolates from dogs in South Korea (345534), Mexico (294708), Chile (117659), Taiwan (858513), Thailand (765208), Brazil (715860) and cats in Brazil (275242, 275246&#x2013;275247).  In total, 17 out of the 44 cats (38.6%) tested positive according to the -, with a higher prevalence of ).

Summary statistics for the animals&#x2019; characteristics and risk factors are presented in -value = 0.038). When the presence of  from any s was considered as an outcome variable, male dogs (76.3%, 29/38) were more prone to being infected in comparison with female dogs (53.1%, 17/32). Odds of infection were 2.8 times higher in male dogs compared to females ( = 2.8,   were more often symptomatic (36.4%, 4/11) than those -negative (5.1%, 3/59). No other significant association was observed between infection with other hemoparasites and gender, health status, and infestation with ectoparasites. The only significant association in cats was between health status and infection with -value = 0.008). No significant association was detected between infection with s in cats and the studied risk factors including sex, age, health status, and infestation with ectoparasites.  In 6/7 dogs and 3/5 cats that were -positive for s, fever, anorexia, emaciation, colics, and red eyes were observed. One dog and two cats with one or more symptoms, however, were -negative for all the s tested (). The high occurrence of -causing pathogens in free-roaming dogs (65.7%) and cats (38.6%) in the Asir Province indicates that animal populations are exposed to multiple s, including those of zoonotic importance, posing both a companion animal and a public health risk. In comparison, however, the absence of all the pathogens in the dogs from Riyadh Province suggests that the climate is less conducive to the survival of ticks compared to the Asir Province, which may in turn contribute to a reduction in the transmission of s. The absence of s in the dogs from Riyadh in the current study is similar to the findings of a previous study, where 53 blood  samples from dogs in Riyadh were ultimately considered free from specific pathogen  [ s.l. parasitising dogs in Riyadh, likely due to its arid climate. Lower numbers of ticks were observed in Riyadh in the current study, providing further evidence that the low annual rainfall and relative humidity restricts the distribution of ectoparasites and the pathogens they vector in Riyadh. In the Middle East, little information is available about the prevalence of canine and feline s; however, results of previous studies in Qatar, Iraq, and Iran showed that stray dogs and cats often act as reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens with the prevalence of 18.8%, 38.1%, 54.6% in dogs [] suggests that controlling this infection in free-roaming dog populations might not be easy.  In this study, hemoplasmas were detected in 27.2% of cats (13.6%, ] and arthropods are considered major players in the epidemiology of hemoplasmas, control of fleas and ticks on dogs and cats is advocated.  ], infected animals may pose high infection risks to owners or veterinary healthcare workers in endemic areas.  The prevalence of . Dogs were not examined for ] as well as the tick species acting as vectors. However, the small number of samples examined in the current study prevent wider conclusions to be drawn regarding the prevalence of s in Saudi Arabia.  The investigation was conducted from November 2018 to August 2019 in the Asir (19.0969&#xB0; N, 42.8638&#xB0; E) and Riyadh (24.7136&#xB0; N, 46.6753&#xB0; E) Provinces, located in southwestern and central Saudi Arabia, respectively (). A total of 188 free-roaming dogs and cats in two provinces of Asir (70 dogs and 44 cats) and Riyadh (74 dogs) ( Tube, Gribbles Veterinary Pathology, Clayton, Victoria, Australia). Dogs and cats were set free after the blood collection. Animal data including age estimated by examination of teeth (1&#x2013;6 years) and sex were recorded. All of the animals except seven dogs and five cats were apparently healthy. The symptoms of the sick animals were moderate or high fever, anorexia, emaciation, colics, and reddish eyes, though they were general and not exclusively related to the specific conditions caused by -causing pathogens. Infestation of the animals with ticks, fleas, and lice was also recorded. Blood samples were refrigerated and transported to the Laboratory of Parasitology, Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science and Humanities, Shaqra University. Total genomic  (g) was isolated from the blood samples using a Wizard Genomic  Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, , ) and eluted into 50 &#x3;L or 100 &#x3;L of the elution buffer according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Aliquots of  were sent to the Veterinary Pathology Diagnostic Services (S), Sydney School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney for molecular diagnostic processing and pathogen identification. Upon arrival at the S, g was stored at &#x2212;20 &#x2;C for up to 1 month prior to screening. The diagnostics of s was performed using the AusDiagnostics real-time quantitative - panel for small animals&#x2019; anemia (Mascot, New South Wales, Australia) on the AusDiagnostics Easy-Plex]. The assay was run using a 10 &#x3;L undiluted g sample and each pathogen was detected during a short (10 cycles) conventional  (c) followed by a second longer R-based q.

All  products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel stained with GelRed). Statistical analyses were performed with the statistics package S ver. 25.0 (, Armonk, , ). A positive  test was set as an outcome variable and the independent variables were age, gender, health status, and infestation with ticks, fleas, or lice. The association of independent variables with outcome variables were evaluated by the chi-squared test, the Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, and binary logistic regression analysis for calculation of the odds ratio. Differences were considered significant if the p-value was &lt; 0.05.

This study evaluated knowledge, opinions and compliance related to Ghana&#x2019;s s among owners and staff of hospitality venues by city, staff designation, and venue type. A cross-sectional study design was used in venue types including hotels, bars, pubs and restaurants in the three cities of Kumasi, Accra, and Tamale, in Ghana. Data were collected between July and September 2019. Interviewer administered face-to-face surveys were conducted with owners and staff (n=142) recruited from randomly selected hospitality venues (n=154) in these three large cities of Ghana. The relationship between knowledge, opinions, and compliance items on s, and city, venue type and staff designation was first studied using &#x3C7; or a Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, and then with univariate logistic regression model analysis. Of the 142 respondents, some had heard of Ghana&#x2019;s 2012 Tobacco Control Act (27.5%), smoking restriction in public places (29%), smoke-free places (22%), and display of &#x2018;no smoking&#x2019; signage (6.3%). Knowledge levels were higher in Accra compared to Tamale (=3.08; 95% : 1.10&#x2013;8.60). Staff designation and type of venue did not have any relationship with knowledge levels. Support for s was over 80%, but opinions in support of s were lower in Accra than Tamale (=0.25; 95% : 0.08&#x2013;0.71). Compliance with s was similar in the three cities. Hotels were three times more compliant compared to bars and pubs (=3.16; 95% : 1.48&#x2013;6.71). The study highlights the strong support for restriction of smoking in public places including hospitality venues despite poor knowledge and low compliance levels with the current s. A review of the current  in Ghana together with education of hospitality staff on the benefits and requirements of s is recommended. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke () attributed to cigarette smoking.  causes heart disease, cancer and many other diseases. The implementation of s in many high-income countries in the past decade has shown substantial public health benefits. Thus, endorsement and implementation of evidence-based policy initiatives such as s are crucial. Currently, Ghana, an C in , has a partial smoking ban, which prohibits smoking in enclosed public areas including hospitality venues such as restaurants, bars and nightclubs but allows for designated smoking areas (s). To identify drivers of attitude towards enforcement of the  in Ghana and to provide information that can be useful for Ghana and other countries facing challenges with implementation of s, we interviewed owners and staff of hospitality venues as a follow-up to our earlier observational air-quality evaluation of hospitality venues. Specifically, we aimed to assess knowledge, opinions and compliance to the provisions of the Tobacco Control Act () (2012) and the , among hospitality venue owners and staff from Ghana&#x2019;s three largest cities. Additionally, we sought to determine whether knowledge, opinions and compliance related to  differ by city, staff designation or hospitality venue type. This will help to inform context-specific recommendations towards the successful implementation of  in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among owners and staff of hospitality venues in three cities in Ghana. The study was conducted in the three largest cities of Ghana (Accra, Kumasi, and Tamale) due to their large population density, diversity and high smoking prevalence. These cities also represent the major cities of the southern, middle and northern belts of the country, respectively. A list of 1532 hospitality venues including bars, pubs, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs in the three cities was obtained from the Ghana tourist authority. These venues were then stratified by the three cities: Accra (n=949), Kumasi (n=457), and Tamale (n=126). Using a margin of error of 5%, confidence limit of 95% and a response rate of 87.7% from earlier studies, a sample size of 154 venues was obtained for the study. A proportionate allocation was then made for the three cities: Accra [(949/1532) &#xD7;154 = 95], Kumasi [(457/1532) &#xD7; 154 = 46], and Tamale [(126/1532) &#xD7; 154 = 13]. A random number generator (Minitab version 17) was then used to randomly select the planned number of venues within each of the three cities (simple random sampling). For consistency, the visits took place between 4 p.m. and midnight in all of the selected venues. In the case where the venue was permanently closed, the venue next on the list was selected. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Stirling (Reference number: P494) and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (Reference number: //441/18). Informed consent was sought from each of the respondents that were interviewed for the study. Fieldworkers carried an official letter during fieldwork describing the study plus evidence of ethical approval and contact details of principal investigators. Data were collected over a 10-week period from July to September 2019, including a three-day pilot data collection in Kumasi. Owners and staff of the hospitality venues were interviewed via a pretested face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire adapted from similar studies. Once the trained interviewers (n=4) arrived at the selected hospitality venues, they were required to seek an informed consent from the managers (or any person with similar authority) before commencement of the survey. If the manager or the owner was not available for an interview, we then interviewed another staff member based on the managers&#x2019; recommendations. Only one eligible and consenting worker was interviewed at each venue due to the busy nature of such settings. Data were collected in a private secure place within the premises to ensure confidentiality. Descriptive variables that were collected included: type of venue (bar, hotel, nightclub, restaurant, pub), staff designation (owner, manager, waiter, other), tobacco products sold (yes or no), nature of venue (only indoor, only outdoor or both indoor and outdoor), types of tobacco products sold at the venue (manufactured cigarettes, hand-rolled cigarettes, pipes, cigars, shisha, electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products), smoking allowed at venue (yes or no), sale of alcohol at venue (yes or no), presence of designated smoking area (yes or no), restriction to minors (yes or no), and smoking status of staff (smoker, non-smoker). Respondents were then assessed on their knowledge, opinions and compliance to the  using  (knowledge, attitude and practice) scores. First, knowledge on Ghana&#x2019;s Tobacco Control Act () and  was assessed using a 9-item scale such as: ban on advertising and promotion (1), components related to  (3), government and tobacco industry interaction (1), advertising and promotion (1), sale and display of tobacco products (1), sale of tobacco products to minors (1), and warning on tobacco products (1). Each item response was coded as either &#x2018;1=yes&#x2019; or &#x2018;0=no&#x2019;. The mean score for each item (across all participants) was calculated and then a mean of those item-specific means was calculated to get the overall mean score. The overall mean score was then used as a cut-off for &#x2018;more knowledge&#x2019; (&#x2265; 0.09) and &#x2018;less knowledge&#x2019; (&lt;0.09) on . Second, their opinions on Ghana&#x2019;s  were assessed by 10 questions on a 5-point Likert scale with options ranging from &#x2018;strongly agree&#x2019; to &#x2018;strongly disagree&#x2019;. The questions included the respondent&#x2019;s opinions on whether they had adequate information on s and their views on the following statements: smoking ban has a negative effect on business, smoking ban causes financial losses, smoking ban is an unfair restriction on smokers, smoking ban results in unemployment, smoke-free bars make visits more comfortable, smoke-free bars protect the health of workers, smoking ban will encourage smokers to quit, smoking ban is necessary in public bars, and prohibition of indoor smoking in public places. For data analysis purposes, we created dichotomous outcome variables with a score of 1 given for &#x2018;agree&#x2019; (strongly agree/ agree) and 0 for &#x2018;disagree&#x2019; (undecided/strongly disagree/disagree). Opinion scores for individual items were also computed in a similar way to knowledge scores. The overall mean score was used as a cut-off to categorize the opinions as &#x2018;agree/ support&#x2019; (&#x2265;0.54) and &#x2018;disagree/against&#x2019; (&lt;0.54). Lastly, compliance with the  included five items with multiple choice options related to the venue&#x2019;s smoking policy. These items included: the respondent&#x2019;s best description of the venue&#x2019;s smoking policy; actions taken if someone smoked at the venue; awareness of violation penalties; law prohibiting sale and advertisements of tobacco products; and importance of no-smoking signage. Each response was coded as compliance (score = 1) or non-compliance (score = 0). The mean score for each item (across all respondents) was calculated and then a mean of those item-specific means was calculated to get the overall mean score. The scale classified a score of &#x2265;0.7 as &#x2018;more compliant&#x2019; and a score of &lt;0.7 as &#x2018;less compliant&#x2019;. Data collected were checked in the field for errors, corrected by the researchers and checked for inconsistencies before exporting into  12. The names of the respondents and of the hospitality venues were not used to ensure anonymity and confidentiality. Descriptive variables such as city, type of venue, presence of designated smoking areas, types of tobacco products sold at the venue, smoking in the premises, and smoking status of interviewee, were reported as frequencies and percentages. The relationship between knowledge, opinions and compliance items on , and city, venue type and staff designation were first studied using &#x3C7; or Fisher&#x2019;s exact test (when the number in the table was &lt;6) and then with a univariate logistic regression model. The results are presented as odds ratios () with 95% confidence interval, with significance set at an alpha level of 5% (p&#x2264;0.05). A total of 154 venues were visited during the period between July to September 2019, but 142 were only analyzed as 12 (7.8%) had incomplete data. The majority of the venues were in Accra, the capital city of Ghana (47.2%), followed by Kumasi (38.0%), and Tamale (14.9%) (Table1). Hotels formed the largest part of the venues visited (69%), and most of the respondents were waiters or receptionists (76.8%). Smoking was allowed in 31% of the venues, and designated smoking areas were present in only 14%. Of the venues, 1.4% had outdoor facilities only and 98.6% had indoor facilities or both (). Approximately one in ten venues (n=18; 12.7%) had tobacco products visible for sale. The tobacco products commonly sold were manufactured cigarettes (15 venues), smokeless tobacco (18 venues) and shisha (10 venues). Characteristics of hospitality venues surveyed in the three cities (N=142) Of the 142 respondents, 27.5% had heard of the  (2012).  provides the findings of knowledge related to the  stratified by city type (Accra, Kumasi, and Tamale), staff designation (owners, other) and venue type (hotel, bars, and pubs). About a third (29%) of the respondents were aware of the restriction of smoking in public places, 22% were aware of smoke-free places and only 6.3% were aware of the display of &#x2018;no smoking&#x2019; signage, as components of the . In addition, only 8.5% of all respondents were aware of the component on ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, and 5% were aware of the components on sale of tobacco and tobacco products. All these components were significantly different across the three cities (p&lt;0.05), with more respondents in Tamale aware of them except for the component on restriction of smoking in public places (Kumasi 29.6%, Accra 35.8%, and Tamale 4.8%). All respondents were unaware of two of the components: warning labels on tobacco products, and limiting Government interaction with tobacco industry. Knowledge items of hospitality venue staff on Ghana&#x2019;s Tobacco Control Act and smoke-free policy : knowledge, attitude and practice. Knowledge scores were assessed by giving 1 to a yes answer and 0 to a no answer for each respondent. Overall mean scores &#x2265;0.09 were taken as more knowledge and &lt;0.09 as less knowledge on Tobacco Control Act. Value of p was based on chi-squared or Fisher&#x2019;s exact test as appropriate, significance set at p&#x2264;0.05. Other: bars, pubs, nightclubs, and restaurants. Other: waiters and receptionists. Overall, respondents had limited knowledge of almost all the components of the  with an overall mean score of 0.09. Respondents in Kumasi had the lowest knowledge scores (0.05), followed by Accra (0.10), and then Tamale (0.13). However, knowledge scores did not differ greatly by venue or staff designations. The mean knowledge scores for two of the smoke-free components (smoke-free places and awareness of restriction of smoking in public places) were higher (0.22 and 0.29, respectively) compared to other components. The lowest mean scores were observed for regulation of tobacco products (0.04). Respondent&#x2019;s mean scores were also low for the component on the need to display &#x2018;no smoking&#x2019; signage (0.06) ().  shows response to the opinions related to  stratified by city, venue and staff designation. Overall, nine in ten respondents supported a smoking ban in all public places: 95% in Accra, 87% in Kumasi, and 76% in Tamale (p=0.028). Similarly, 89% of all respondents supported a smoking ban in hospitality venues. A high percentage of hotel staff (92%) supported the ban compared to the staff of other venues such as bars/pubs (81%) (p=0.048), but no differences were observed across the three cities. With regard to a smoking ban protecting the health of workers, all respondents from Kumasi, and &gt;80% from Accra and Tamale, agreed with that statement (p=0.016). Overall, over half of the respondents disagreed with the statement that smoking ban will have a negative effect on business: Kumasi 61.1%, Accra 86.8%, and Tamale 52.4% (p&lt;0.001). However, about half of the respondents in Kumasi (53.7%) and Tamale (57.1%), and about a fourth from Accra (23.9%), agreed with the statement that a smoking ban will result in unemployment (p=0.001). In addition, about a third of the respondents (30.3%) agreed with the statement that the smoking ban is an unfair restriction on smokers, and this was significantly different across the three cities with over half from Tamale and a fourth from Accra and Kumasi (p=0.015). Staff designation did not have any significant association with any of the responses to the opinions related to . Opinions of hospitality venue staff on Ghana&#x2019;s smoke-free law : knowledge, attitude and practice. Opinion was assessed as a score of 1 for agree/support and 0 for disagree/do not support. The scale classified opinion as agree/support with scores &#x2265;0.54 and disagree/against &lt;0.54. Value of p was based on chi-squared or Fisher&#x2019;s exact test as appropriate, significance set at p&#x2264;0.05. In general, respondents had a positive attitude towards supporting  with an overall mean score of 0.54. Scores were highest for opinions related to prohibition of indoor smoking in public places (0.89), smoking ban is necessary in public bars (0.89), smoking ban protects the health of workers (0.96), and smoke-free bars make visits more comfortable (0.82). The lowest scores were observed for opinions related to whether respondents were adequately informed on  (0.17), with only 17% of the staff feeling that they were adequately informed of the  ().  shows the response to items related to compliance to  at the premises visited based on city, type of venue, and role of staff. About eight in ten hotels (84.7%) have an indoor  policy that does not allow smoking in any indoor area compared to only about half of the bars and pubs (54.5%) (p&lt;0.001). In addition, only 6% of respondents in Accra were aware of violation penalties on smoking in public places, compared to 29.6% in Kumasi and 19% in Tamale (p=0.002). However, awareness of violation penalties was not significantly associated with the venue or staff designation. In addition, just under half (49%) of hotel staff were likely to ask individuals to leave the premise if they detected smoking activity, compared to 29% of other venue staff (p=0.007). Further, hotels were more likely to have &#x2018;no smoking&#x2019; signs (76.6%), in comparison with other venues (43.2%) (p=0.007). Compliance towards Ghana&#x2019;s smoke-free policy : knowledge, attitude and practice. Compliance was assessed by giving a score of 1 to compliance and 0 to non-compliance. The scale classified less compliant as an overall mean score &lt;0.7 and more compliant &#x2265;0.7. Value of p was based on chi-squared or Fisher&#x2019;s exact test as appropriate, significance set at p&#x2264;0.05. Other: bars, pubs, nightclubs, and restaurants. Other: waiters and receptionists. The overall mean score of compliance to  was 0.7. Compliance scores were lowest in Accra (0.68) in comparison with Kumasi (0.70) and Tamale (0.71), and hotels were observed to be more complaint (mean score 0.74) than other venues (mean score 0.59).

This study sought to determine the knowledge, opinions and compliance of hospitality venue staff towards the current  in three cities in Ghana. Knowledge levels related to the  among hospitality venue workers in the three cities were found to be very low. Among the three cities, the odds of having high knowledge scores were three times higher in Accra compared to Tamale, and Kumasi had lower knowledge scores compared to Tamale. High opinion scores in support were observed for prohibition of indoor smoking, smoking ban is necessary in public bars, smoking ban protects health of workers, and smoke-free bars make visits more comfortable. Compliance to smoke-free laws was higher in Tamale compared to Accra and Kumasi. Also, hotels were found to be more compliant than bars and pubs. Staff designation did not have any effect on knowledge, compliance levels or opinions in support for s. Studies in African countries such as Nigeria and hospitality industry workers have been known to have higher levels exposures to . Comparable to earlier studies in Ghana among adults. Findings from our earlier study. Future studies on perceptions of civil society organizations and policy makers in Ghana on smoke-free law implementation and challenges, and opportunities related to achieving compliance with a particular focus on hospitality venues, are needed. The study has a number of limitations. First, findings were based on self-reports and it is possible that respondents could display social desirability bias in their response and articulate socially acceptable views on tobacco control. All respondents were, however, assured that their responses were anonymous in order to reduce this bias. Second, our study is limited to only three major cities and the findings may therefore not be representative of all hospitality venues in the country. The exclusion of the 12 venues with missing data might also slightly reduce the generalizability of the findings. Third, the sample size was relatively small, which reduced the power of the study to observe statistically significant differences between the groups. Fourth, most of our respondents were waiters and receptionists rather than managers and owners (who were unavailable for the interviews due to their limited availability), which has to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. Despite these limitations, our study provides strong evidence on the knowledge, opinion and compliance of hospitality staff towards the  in Ghana using a validated questionnaire and the selection of the three largest cities in Ghana are potential strengths of this study. Our findings highlight strong support for prohibition of smoking in public places including hospitality venues despite poor knowledge and low compliance levels with the current s in Ghana. Ghana urgently needs to step up efforts that will help accomplish the obligations of the C Article 8. In order to achieve this, there is the need to prioritize the enforcement and implementation of existing legislation. A further action is for policy makers and civil society organizations advocates dedicating resources to implement targeted media and educational campaigns to inform the public/hospitality workers about the health hazards of  to the non-smokers.
